Smaller weights in a neural network can result in a model that is more stable and less likely to overfit the training dataset, in turn having better performance when making a prediction on new data. Unlike weight regularization, a weight constraint is a trigger that checks the size or magnitude of the weights and scales them so that they are all below a pre-defined threshold. The constraint forces weights to be small and can be used instead of weight decay and in conjunction with more aggressive network configurations, such as very large learning rates. In this post, you will discover the use of weight constraint regularization as an alternative to weight penalties to reduce overfitting in deep neural networks. After reading this post, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. A Gentle Introduction to Weight Constraints to Reduce Generalization Error in Deep LearningPhoto by Dawn Ellner, some rights reserved. Large weights in a neural network are a sign of overfitting. A network with large weights has very likely learned the statistical noise in the training data. This results in a model that is unstable, and very sensitive to changes to the input variables. In turn, the overfit network has poor performance when making predictions on new unseen data. A popular and effective technique to address the problem is to update the loss function that is optimized during training to take the size of the weights into account. This is called a penalty, as the larger the weights of the network become, the more the network is penalized, resulting in larger loss and, in turn, larger updates. The effect is that the penalty encourages weights to be small, or no larger than is required during the training process, in turn reducing overfitting. A problem in using a penalty is that although it does encourage the network toward smaller weights, it does not force smaller weights. A neural network trained with weight regularization penalty may still allow large weights, in some cases very large weights. An alternate solution to using a penalty for the size of network weights is to use a weight constraint. A weight constraint is an update to the network that checks the size of the weights, and if the size exceeds a predefined limit, the weights are rescaled so that their size is below the limit or between a range. You can think of a weight constraint as an if-then rule checking the size of the weights while the network is being trained and only coming into effect and making weights small when required. Note, for efficiency, it does not have to be implemented as an if-then rule and often is not. Unlike adding a penalty to the loss function, a weight constraint ensures the weights of the network are small, instead of mearly encouraging them to be small. It can be useful on those problems or with networks that resist other regularization methods, such as weight penalties. Weight constraints prove especially useful when you have configured your network to use alternative regularization methods to weight regularization and yet still desire the network to have small weights in order to reduce overfitting. One often-cited example is the use of a weight constraint regularization with dropout regularization. Although dropout alone gives significant improvements, using dropout along with [weight constraint] regularization, [¡¦] provides a significant boost over just using dropout. <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. A constraint is enforced on each node within a layer. All nodes within the layer use the same constraint, and often multiple hidden layers within the same network will use the same constraint. Recall that when we talk about the vector norm in general, that this is the magnitude of the vector of weights in a node, and by default is calculated as the L2 norm, e.g. the square root of the sum of the squared values in the vector. Some examples of constraints that could be used include: The maximum norm, also called max-norm or maxnorm, is a popular constraint because it is less aggressive than other norms such as the unit norm, simply setting an upper bound. Max-norm regularization has been previously used [¡¦] It typically improves the performance of stochastic gradient descent training of deep neural nets ¡¦ <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. When using a limit or a range, a hyperparameter must be specified. Given that weights are small, the hyperparameter too is often a small integer value, such as a value between 1 and 4. ¡¦ we can use max-norm regularization. This constrains the norm of the vector of incoming weights at each hidden unit to be bound by a constant c. Typical values of c range from 3 to 4. <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. If the norm exceeds the specified range or limit, the weights are rescaled or normalized such that their magnitude is below the specified parameter or within the specified range. If a weight-update violates this constraint, we renormalize the weights of the hidden unit by division. Using a constraint rather than a penalty prevents weights from growing very large no matter how large the proposed weight-update is. <U+2014> Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors, 2012. The constraint can be applied after each update to the weights, e.g. at the end of each mini-batch. This section provides a few cherry-picked examples from recent research papers where a weight constraint was used. Geoffrey Hinton, et al. in their 2012 paper titled ¡°Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors¡± used a maxnorm constraint on CNN models applied to the MNIST handwritten digit classification task and ImageNet photo classification task. All layers had L2 weight constraints on the incoming weights of each hidden unit. Nitish Srivastava, et al. in their 2014 paper titled ¡°Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting¡± used a maxnorm constraint with an MLP on the MNIST handwritten digit classification task and with CNNs on the streetview house numbers dataset with the parameter configured via a holdout validation set. Max-norm regularization was used for weights in both convolutional and fully connected layers. Jan Chorowski, et al. in their 2015 paper titled ¡°Attention-Based Models for Speech Recognition¡± use LSTM and attention models for speech recognition with a max norm constraint set to 1. We first trained our models with a column norm constraint with the maximum norm 1 ¡¦ This section provides some tips for using weight constraints with your neural network. Weight constraints are a generic approach. They can be used with most, perhaps all, types of neural network models, not least the most common network types of Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks. In the case of LSTMs, it may be desirable to use different constraints or constraint configurations for the input and recurrent connections. It is a good general practice to rescale input variables to have the same scale. When input variables have different scales, the scale of the weights of the network will, in turn, vary accordingly. This introduces a problem when using weight constraints because large weights will cause the constraint to trigger more frequently. This problem can be done by either normalization or standardization of input variables. The use of a weight constraint allows you to be more aggressive during the training of the network. Specifically, a larger learning rate can be used, allowing the network to, in turn, make larger updates to the weights each update. This is cited as an important benefit to using weight constraints. Such as the use of a constraint in conjunction with dropout: Using a constraint rather than a penalty prevents weights from growing very large no matter how large the proposed weight-update is. This makes it possible to start with a very large learning rate which decays during learning, thus allowing a far more thorough search of the weight-space than methods that start with small weights and use a small learning rate. <U+2014> Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors, 2012. Explore the use of other weight constraints, such as a minimum and maximum range, non-negative weights, and more. You may also choose to use constraints on some weights and not others, such as not using constraints on bias weights in an MLP or not using constraints on recurrent connections in an LSTM. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered the use of weight constraint regularization as an alternative to weight penalties to reduce overfitting in deep neural networks. Specifically, you learned: Do you have any questions?

"mastery",2018-11-21,"How to Reduce Overfitting of a Deep Learning Model with Weight Regularization","https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-reduce-overfitting-in-deep-learning-with-weight-regularization/","Weight regularization provides an approach to reduce the overfitting of a deep learning neural network model on the training data and improve the performance of the model on new data, such as the holdout test set. There are multiple types of weight regularization, such as L1 and L2 vector norms, and each requires a hyperparameter that must be configured. In this tutorial, you will discover how to apply weight regularization to improve the performance of an overfit deep learning neural network in Python with Keras. After completing this tutorial, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. How to Reduce Overfitting in Deep Learning With Weight RegularizationPhoto by Seabamirum, some rights reserved. This tutorial is divided into three parts; they are: Keras provides a weight regularization API that allows you to add a penalty for weight size to the loss function. Three different regularizer instances are provided; they are: The regularizers are provided under keras.regularizers and have the names l1, l2 and l1_l2. Each takes the regularizer hyperparameter as an argument. For example: By default, no regularizer is used in any layers. A weight regularizer can be added to each layer when the layer is defined in a Keras model. This is achieved by setting the kernel_regularizer argument on each layer. A separate regularizer can also be used for the bias via the bias_regularizer argument, although this is less often used. Let¡¯s look at some examples. The example below sets an l2 regularizer on a Dense fully connected layer: Like the Dense layer, the Convolutional layers (e.g. Conv1D and Conv2D) also use the kernel_regularizer and bias_regularizer arguments to define a regularizer. The example below sets an l2 regularizer on a Conv2D convolutional layer: Recurrent layers like the LSTM offer more flexibility in regularizing the weights. The input, recurrent, and bias weights can all be regularized separately via the kernel_regularizer, recurrent_regularizer, and bias_regularizer arguments. The example below sets an l2 regularizer on an LSTM recurrent layer: It can be helpful to look at some examples of weight regularization configurations reported in the literature. It is important to select and tune a regularization technique specific to your network and dataset, although real examples can also give an idea of common configurations that may be a useful starting point. Recall that 0.1 can be written in scientific notation as 1e-1 or 1E-1 or as an exponential 10^-1, 0.01 as 1e-2 or 10^-2 and so on. Weight regularization was borrowed from penalized regression models in statistics. The most common type of regularization is L2, also called simply ¡°weight decay,¡± with values often on a logarithmic scale between 0 and 0.1, such as 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, etc. Reasonable values of lambda [regularization hyperparameter] range between 0 and 0.1. <U+2014> Page 144, Applied Predictive Modeling, 2013. The classic text on Multilayer Perceptrons ¡°Neural Smithing: Supervised Learning in Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks¡± provides a worked example demonstrating the impact of weight decay by first training a model without any regularization, then steadily increasing the penalty. They demonstrate graphically that weight decay has the effect of improving the resulting decision function. ¡¦ net was trained [¡¦] with weight decay increasing from 0 to 1E-5 at 1200 epochs, to 1E-4 at 2500 epochs, and to 1E-3 at 400 epochs. [¡¦] The surface is smoother and transitions are more gradual <U+2014> Page 270, Neural Smithing: Supervised Learning in Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks, 1999. This is an interesting procedure that may be worth investigating. The authors also comment on the difficulty of predicting the effect of weight decay on a problem. ¡¦ it is difficult to predict ahead of time what value is needed to achieve desired results. The value of 0.001 was chosen arbitrarily because it is a typically cited round number <U+2014> Page 270, Neural Smithing: Supervised Learning in Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks, 1999. Weight regularization does not seem widely used in CNN models, or if it is used, its use is not widely reported. L2 weight regularization with very small regularization hyperparameters such as (e.g. 0.0005 or 5 x 10^<U+2212>4) may be a good starting point. Alex Krizhevsky, et al. from the University of Toronto in their 2012 paper titled ¡°ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks¡± developed a deep CNN model for the ImageNet dataset, achieving then state-of-the-art results reported: ¡¦and weight decay of 0.0005. We found that this small amount of weight decay was important for the model to learn. In other words, weight decay here is not merely a regularizer: it reduces the model¡¯s training error. Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman from Oxford in their 2015 paper titled ¡°Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition¡± develop a CNN for the ImageNet dataset and report: The training was regularised by weight decay (the L2 penalty multiplier set to 5 x 10^<U+2212>4) Francois Chollet from Google (and author of Keras) in his 2016 paper titled ¡°Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions¡± reported the weight decay for both the Inception V3 CNN model from Google (not clear from the Inception V3 paper) and the weight decay used in his improved Xception for the ImageNet dataset: The Inception V3 model uses a weight decay (L2 regularization) rate of 4e<U+2212>5, which has been carefully tuned for performance on ImageNet. We found this rate to be quite suboptimal for Xception and instead settled for 1e<U+2212>5. It is common to use weight regularization with LSTM models. An often used configuration is L2 (weight decay) and very small hyperparameters (e.g. 10^<U+2212>6). It is often not reported what weights are regularized (input, recurrent, and/or bias), although one would assume that both input and recurrent weights are regularized only. Gabriel Pereyra, et al. from Google Brain in the 2017 paper titled ¡°Regularizing Neural Networks by Penalizing Confident Output Distributions¡± apply a seq2seq LSTMs models to predicting characters from the Wall Street Journal and report: All models used weight decay of 10^<U+2212>6 Barret Zoph and Quoc Le from Google Brain in the 2017 paper titled ¡°Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning¡± use LSTMs and reinforcement learning to learn network architectures to best address the CIFAR-10 dataset and report: weight decay of 1e-4 Ron Weiss, et al. from Google Brain and Nvidia in their 2017 paper titled ¡°Sequence-to-Sequence Models Can Directly Translate Foreign Speech¡± develop a sequence-to-sequence LSTM for speech translation and report: L2 weight decay is used with a weight of 10^<U+2212>6 In this section, we will demonstrate how to use weight regularization to reduce overfitting of an MLP on a simple binary classification problem. This example provides a template for applying weight regularization to your own neural network for classification and regression problems. We will use a standard binary classification problem that defines two semi-circles of observations: one semi-circle for each class. Each observation has two input variables with the same scale and a class output value of either 0 or 1. This dataset is called the ¡°moons¡± dataset because of the shape of the observations in each class when plotted. We can use the make_moons() function to generate observations from this problem. We will add noise to the data and seed the random number generator so that the same samples are generated each time the code is run. We can plot the dataset where the two variables are taken as x and y coordinates on a graph and the class value is taken as the color of the observation. The complete example of generating the dataset and plotting it is listed below. Running the example creates a scatter plot showing the semi-circle or moon shape of the observations in each class. We can see the noise in the dispersal of the points making the moons less obvious. Scatter Plot of Moons Dataset With Color Showing the Class Value of Each Sample This is a good test problem because the classes cannot be separated by a line, e.g. are not linearly separable, requiring a nonlinear method such as a neural network to address. We have only generated 100 samples, which is small for a neural network, providing the opportunity to overfit the training dataset and have higher error on the test dataset: a good case for using regularization. Further, the samples have noise, giving the model an opportunity to learn aspects of the samples that don¡¯t generalize. We can develop an MLP model to address this binary classification problem. The model will have one hidden layer with more nodes that may be required to solve this problem, providing an opportunity to overfit. We will also train the model for longer than is required to ensure the model overfits. Before we define the model, we will split the dataset into train and test sets, using 30 examples to train the model and 70 to evaluate the fit model¡¯s performance. Next, we can define the model. The model uses 500 nodes in the hidden layer and the rectified linear activation function. A sigmoid activation function is used in the output layer in order to predict class values of 0 or 1. The model is optimized using the binary cross entropy loss function, suitable for binary classification problems and the efficient Adam version of gradient descent. The defined model is then fit on the training data for 4,000 epochs and the default batch size of 32. Finally, we can evaluate the performance of the model on the test dataset and report the result. We can tie all of these pieces together; the complete example is listed below. Running the example reports the model performance on the train and test datasets. We can see that the model has better performance on the training dataset than the test dataset, one possible sign of overfitting. Your specific results may vary given the stochastic nature of the neural network and the training algorithm. Because the model is severely overfit, we generally would not expect much, if any, variance in the accuracy across repeated runs of the model on the same dataset. Another sign of overfitting is a plot of the learning curves of the model for both train and test datasets while training. An overfit model should show accuracy increasing on both train and test and at some point accuracy drops on the test dataset but continues to rise on the test dataset. We can update the example to plot these curves. The complete example is listed below. Running the example creates line plots of the model accuracy on the train and test sets. We can see an expected shape of an overfit model where test accuracy increases to a point and then begins to decrease again. Line Plots of Accuracy on Train and Test Datasets While Training We can add weight regularization to the hidden layer to reduce the overfitting of the model to the training dataset and improve the performance on the holdout set. We will use the L2 vector norm also called weight decay with a regularization parameter (called alpha or lambda) of 0.001, chosen arbitrarily. This can be done by adding the kernel_regularizer argument to the layer and setting it to an instance of l2. The updated example of fitting and evaluating the model on the moons dataset with weight regularization is listed below. Running the example reports the performance of the model on the train and test datasets. We can see no change in the accuracy on the training dataset and an improvement on the test dataset. We would expect that the telltale learning curve for overfitting would also have been changed through the use of weight regularization. Instead of the accuracy of the model on the test set increasing and then decreasing again, we should see it continually rise during training. The complete example of fitting the model and plotting the train and test learning curves is listed below. Running the example creates line plots of the train and test accuracy for the model for each epoch during training. As expected, we see the learning curve on the test dataset rise and then plateau, indicating that the model may not have overfit the training dataset. Line Plots of Accuracy on Train and Test Datasets While Training Without Overfitting Once you can confirm that weight regularization may improve your overfit model, you can test different values of the regularization parameter. It is a good practice to first grid search through some orders of magnitude between 0.0 and 0.1, then once a level is found, to grid search on that level. We can grid search through the orders of magnitude by defining the values to test, looping through each and recording the train and test performance. Once we have all of the values, we can graph the results as a line plot to help spot any patterns in the configurations to the train and test accuracies. Because parameters jump orders of magnitude (powers of 10), we can create a line plot of the results using a logarithmic scale. The Matplotlib library allows this via the semilogx() function. For example: The complete example for grid searching weight regularization values on the moon dataset is listed below. Running the example prints the parameter value and the accuracy on the train and test sets for each evaluated model. The results suggest that 0.01 or 0.001 may be sufficient and may provide good bounds for further grid searching. A line plot of the results is also created, showing the increase in test accuracy with larger weight regularization parameter values, at least to a point. We can see that using the largest value of 0.1 results in a large drop in both train and test accuracy. Line Plot of Model Accuracy on Train and Test Datasets With Different Weight Regularization Parameters This section lists some ideas for extending the tutorial that you may wish to explore. If you explore any of these extensions, I¡¯d love to know. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper.

"mastery",2018-11-19,"Use Weight Regularization to Reduce Overfitting of Deep Learning Models","https://machinelearningmastery.com/weight-regularization-to-reduce-overfitting-of-deep-learning-models/","Neural networks learn a set of weights that best map inputs to outputs. A network with large network weights can be a sign of an unstable network where small changes in the input can lead to large changes in the output. This can be a sign that the network has overfit the training dataset and will likely perform poorly when making predictions on new data. A solution to this problem is to update the learning algorithm to encourage the network to keep the weights small. This is called weight regularization and it can be used as a general technique to reduce overfitting of the training dataset and improve the generalization of the model. In this post, you will discover weight regularization as an approach to reduce overfitting for neural networks. After reading this post, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. A Gentle Introduction to Weight Regularization to Reduce Overfitting for Deep Learning ModelsPhoto by jojo nicdao, some rights reserved. When fitting a neural network model, we must learn the weights of the network (i.e. the model parameters) using stochastic gradient descent and the training dataset. The longer we train the network, the more specialized the weights will become to the training data, overfitting the training data. The weights will grow in size in order to handle the specifics of the examples seen in the training data. Large weights make the network unstable. Although the weight will be specialized to the training dataset, minor variation or statistical noise on the expected inputs will result in large differences in the output. Large weights tend to cause sharp transitions in the node functions and thus large changes in output for small changes in the inputs. <U+2014> Page 269 Neural Smithing: Supervised Learning in Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks, 1999. Generally, we refer to this model as having a large variance and a small bias. That is, the model is sensitive to the specific examples, the statistical noise, in the training dataset. A model with large weights is more complex than a model with smaller weights. It is a sign of a network that may be overly specialized to training data. In practice, we prefer to choose the simpler models to solve a problem (e.g. Occam¡¯s razor). We prefer models with smaller weights. ¡¦ given some training data and a network architecture, multiple sets of weight values (multiple models) could explain the data. Simpler models are less likely to over-fit than complex ones. A simple model in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy <U+2014> Page 107, Deep Learning with Python, 2017. Another possible issue is that there may be many input variables, each with different levels of relevance to the output variable. Sometimes we can use methods to aid in selecting input variables, but often the interrelationships between variables is not obvious. Having small weights or even zero weights for less relevant or irrelevant inputs to the network will allow the model to focus learning. This too will result in a simpler model. The learning algorithm can be updated to encourage the network toward using small weights. One way to do this is to change the calculation of loss used in the optimization of the network to also consider the size of the weights. Remember, that when we train a neural network, we minimize a loss function, such as the log loss in classification or mean squared error in regression. In calculating the loss between the predicted and expected values in a batch, we can add the current size of all weights in the network or add in a layer to this calculation. This is called a penalty because we are penalizing the model proportional to the size of the weights in the model. Many regularization approaches are based on limiting the capacity of models, such as neural networks, linear regression, or logistic regression, by adding a [¡¦] penalty to the objective function. <U+2014> Page 230, Deep Learning, 2016. Larger weights result in a larger penalty, in the form of a larger loss score. The optimization algorithm will then push the model to have smaller weights, i.e. weights no larger than needed to perform well on the training dataset. Smaller weights are considered more regular or less specialized and as such, we refer to this penalty as weight regularization. When this approach of penalizing model coefficients is used in other machine learning models such as linear regression or logistic regression, it may be referred to as shrinkage, because the penalty encourages the coefficients to shrink during the optimization process. Shrinkage. This approach involves fitting a model involving all p predictors. However, the estimated coefficients are shrunken towards zero [¡¦] This shrinkage (also known as regularization) has the effect of reducing variance <U+2014> Page 204, An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R, 2013. The addition of a weight size penalty or weight regularization to a neural network has the effect of reducing generalization error and of allowing the model to pay less attention to less relevant input variables. 1) It suppresses any irrelevant components of the weight vector by choosing the smallest vector that solves the learning problem. 2) If the size is chosen right, a weight decay can suppress some of the effect of static noise on the targets. <U+2014> A Simple Weight Decay Can Improve Generalization, 1992. There are two parts to penalizing the model based on the size of the weights. The first is the calculation of the size of the weights, and the second is the amount of attention that the optimization process should pay to the penalty. Neural network weights are real-values that can be positive or negative, as such, simply adding the weights is not sufficient. There are two main approaches used to calculate the size of the weights, they are: L1 encourages weights to 0.0 if possible, resulting in more sparse weights (weights with more 0.0 values). L2 offers more nuance, both penalizing larger weights more severely, but resulting in less sparse weights. The use of L2 in linear and logistic regression is often referred to as Ridge Regression. This is useful to know when trying to develop an intuition for the penalty or examples of its usage. In other academic communities, L2 regularization is also known as ridge regression or Tikhonov regularization. <U+2014> Page 231, Deep Learning, 2016. The weights may be considered a vector and the magnitude of a vector is called its norm, from linear algebra. As such, penalizing the model based on the size of the weights is also referred to as a weight or parameter norm penalty. It is possible to include both L1 and L2 approaches to calculating the size of the weights as the penalty. This is akin to the use of both penalties used in the Elastic Net algorithm for linear and logistic regression. The L2 approach is perhaps the most used and is traditionally referred to as ¡°weight decay¡± in the field of neural networks. It is called ¡°shrinkage¡± in statistics, a name that encourages you to think of the impact of the penalty on the model weights during the learning process. This particular choice of regularizer is known in the machine learning literature as weight decay because in sequential learning algorithms, it encourages weight values to decay towards zero, unless supported by the data. In statistics, it provides an example of a parameter shrinkage method because it shrinks parameter values towards zero. <U+2014> Page 144-145, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, 2006. Recall that each node has input weights and a bias weight. The bias weight is generally not included in the penalty because the ¡°input¡± is constant. The calculated size of the weights is added to the loss objective function when training the network. Rather than adding each weight to the penalty directly, they can be weighted using a new hyperparameter called alpha (a) or sometimes lambda. This controls the amount of attention that the learning process should pay to the penalty. Or put another way, the amount to penalize the model based on the size of the weights. The alpha hyperparameter has a value between 0.0 (no penalty) and 1.0 (full penalty). This hyperparameter controls the amount of bias in the model from 0.0, or low bias (high variance), to 1.0, or high bias (low variance). If the penalty is too strong, the model will underestimate the weights and underfit the problem. If the penalty is too weak, the model will be allowed to overfit the training data. The vector nor of the weights is often calculated per-layer, rather than across the entire network. This allows more flexibility in the choice of the type of regularization used (e.g. L1 for inputs, L2 elsewhere) and flexibility in the alpha value, although it is common to use the same alpha value on each layer by default. In the context of neural networks, it is sometimes desirable to use a separate penalty with a different a coefficient for each layer of the network. Because it can be expensive to search for the correct value of multiple hyperparameters, it is still reasonable to use the same weight decay at all layers just to reduce the size of search space. <U+2014> Page 230, Deep Learning, 2016. This section provides some tips for using weight regularization with your neural network. Weight regularization is a generic approach. It can be used with most, perhaps all, types of neural network models, not least the most common network types of Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks. In the case of LSTMs, it may be desirable to use different penalties or penalty configurations for the input and recurrent connections. It is generally good practice to update input variables to have the same scale. When input variables have different scales, the scale of the weights of the network will, in turn, vary accordingly. This introduces a problem when using weight regularization because the absolute or squared values of the weights must be added for use in the penalty. This problem can be addressed by either normalizing or standardizing input variables. It is common for larger networks (more layers or more nodes) to more easily overfit the training data. When using weight regularization, it is possible to use larger networks with less risk of overfitting. A good configuration strategy may be to start with larger networks and use weight decay. It is common to use small values for the regularization hyperparameter that controls the contribution of each weight to the penalty. Perhaps start by testing values on a log scale, such as 0.1, 0.001, and 0.0001. Then use a grid search at the order of magnitude that shows the most promise. Rather than trying to choose between L1 and L2 penalties, use both. Modern and effective linear regression methods such as the Elastic Net use both L1 and L2 penalties at the same time and this can be a useful approach to try. This gives you both the nuance of L2 and the sparsity encouraged by L1. The use of weight regularization may allow more elaborate training schemes. For example, a model may be fit on training data first without any regularization, then updated later with the use of a weight penalty to reduce the size of the weights of the already well-performing model. Do you have any tips for using weight regularization?
Let me know in the comments below. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered weight regularization as an approach to reduce overfitting for neural networks. Specifically, you learned: Do you have any questions?
Ask your questions in the comments below and I will do my best to answer. Another possible type of weight penalty is ¡°Exp[Abs[w]] <U+2013> 1¡± which would encourage zero weights although not so strongly as L1, while at the same time strongly penalising large weights similarly to L2 (but stronger). Very nice! Thanks. Comment  Name (required)  Email (will not be published) (required)  Website"
