Two hyperparameters that often confuse beginners are the batch size and number of epochs. They are both integer values and seem to do the same thing. In this post, you will discover the difference between batches and epochs in stochastic gradient descent. After reading this post, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. What is the Difference Between a Batch and an Epoch in a Neural Network?Photo by Graham Cook, some rights reserved. This post is divided into five parts; they are: Stochastic Gradient Descent, or SGD for short, is an optimization algorithm used to train machine learning algorithms, most notably artificial neural networks used in deep learning. The job of the algorithm is to find a set of internal model parameters that perform well against some performance measure such as logarithmic loss or mean squared error. Optimization is a type of searching process and you can think of this search as learning. The optimization algorithm is called ¡°gradient descent¡°, where ¡°gradient¡± refers to the calculation of an error gradient or slope of error and ¡°descent¡± refers to the moving down along that slope towards some minimum level of error. The algorithm is iterative. This means that the search process occurs over multiple discrete steps, each step hopefully slightly improving the model parameters. Each step involves using the model with the current set of internal parameters to make predictions on some samples, comparing the predictions to the real expected outcomes, calculating the error, and using the error to update the internal model parameters. This update procedure is different for different algorithms, but in the case of artificial neural networks, the backpropagation update algorithm is used. Before we dive into batches and epochs, let¡¯s take a look at what we mean by sample. Learn more about gradient descent here: A sample is a single row of data. It contains inputs that are fed into the algorithm and an output that is used to compare to the prediction and calculate an error. A training dataset is comprised of many rows of data, e.g. many samples. A sample may also be called an instance, an observation, an input vector, or a feature vector. Now that we know what a sample is, let¡¯s define a batch. The batch size is a hyperparameter that defines the number of samples to work through before updating the internal model parameters. Think of a batch as a for-loop iterating over one or more samples and making predictions. At the end of the batch, the predictions are compared to the expected output variables and an error is calculated. From this error, the update algorithm is used to improve the model, e.g. move down along the error gradient. A training dataset can be divided into one or more batches. When all training samples are used to create one batch, the learning algorithm is called batch gradient descent. When the batch is the size of one sample, the learning algorithm is called stochastic gradient descent. When the batch size is more than one sample and less than the size of the training dataset, the learning algorithm is called mini-batch gradient descent. In the case of mini-batch gradient descent, popular batch sizes include 32, 64, and 128 samples. You may see these values used in models in the literature and in tutorials. What if the dataset does not divide evenly by the batch size? This can and does happen often when training a model. It simply means that the final batch has fewer samples than the other batches. Alternately, you can remove some samples from the dataset or change the batch size such that the number of samples in the dataset does divide evenly by the batch size. For more on the differences between these variations of gradient descent, see the post: A batch involves an update to the model using samples; next, let¡¯s look at an epoch. The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number times that the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. One epoch means that each sample in the training dataset has had an opportunity to update the internal model parameters. An epoch is comprised of one or more batches. For example, as above, an epoch that has one batch is called the batch gradient descent learning algorithm. You can think of a for-loop over the number of epochs where each loop proceeds over the training dataset. Within this for-loop is another nested for-loop that iterates over each batch of samples, where one batch has the specified ¡°batch size¡± number of samples. The number of epochs is traditionally large, often hundreds or thousands, allowing the learning algorithm to run until the error from the model has been sufficiently minimized. You may see examples of the number of epochs in the literature and in tutorials set to 10, 100, 500, 1000, and larger. It is common to create line plots that show epochs along the x-axis as time and the error or skill of the model on the y-axis. These plots are sometimes called learning curves. These plots can help to diagnose whether the model has over learned, under learned, or is suitably fit to the training dataset. For more on diagnostics via learning curves with LSTM networks, see the post: In case it is still not clear, let¡¯s look at the differences between batches and epochs. The batch size is a number of samples processed before the model is updated. The number of epochs is the number of complete passes through the training dataset. The size of a batch must be more than or equal to one and less than or equal to the number of samples in the training dataset. The number of epochs can be set to an integer value between one and infinity. You can run the algorithm for as long as you like and even stop it using other criteria besides a fixed number of epochs, such as a change (or lack of change) in model error over time. They are both integer values and they are both hyperparameters for the learning algorithm, e.g. parameters for the learning process, not internal model parameters found by the learning process. You must specify the batch size and number of epochs for a learning algorithm. There are no magic rules for how to configure these parameters. You must try different values and see what works best for your problem. Finally, let¡¯s make this concrete with a small example. Assume you have a dataset with 200 samples (rows of data) and you choose a batch size of 5 and 1,000 epochs. This means that the dataset will be divided into 40 batches, each with five samples. The model weights will be updated after each batch of five samples. This also means that one epoch will involve 40 batches or 40 updates to the model. With 1,000 epochs, the model will be exposed to or pass through the whole dataset 1,000 times. That is a total of 40,000 batches during the entire training process. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered the difference between batches and epochs in stochastic gradient descent. Specifically, you learned: Do you have any questions?

Did the example at the end help? in modern deeeep learning approaches, i almost always encounter that people save their models after some number of epoches (or some time period) while visualizing some kind of performance metrics to evaluate the next values for the hyperparams, thereafter do they carry out their experiments for the next epochs. So we can call this procedure as ¡®mini epoch stochactic deep learning¡¯. Thanks. Thanks for sharing.

"mastery",2018-07-18,"The Role of Randomization to Address Confounding Variables in Machine Learning","https://machinelearningmastery.com/confounding-variables-in-machine-learning/","A large part of applied machine learning is about running controlled experiments to discover what algorithm or algorithm configuration to use on a predictive modeling problem. A challenge is that there are aspects of the problem and the algorithm called confounding variables that cannot be controlled (held constant) and must be controlled-for. An example is the use of randomness in a learning algorithm, such as random initialization or random choices during learning. The solution is to use randomness in a way that has become a standard in applied machine learning. We can learn more about the rationale for using randomness in controlled experiments by looking briefly at why randomness is used to manage confounding variables in medicine through the use of randomized clinical trials. In this post, you will discover confounding variables and how we can address them using the tool of randomization. After reading this post, you will know: Let¡¯s get started.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course In an experiment, we are often interested in the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable. A confounding variable is a variable that confuses the relationship between the independent and the dependent variable. Confounding, sometimes referred to as confounding bias, is mostly described as a ¡®mixing¡¯ or ¡®blurring¡¯ of effects. <U+2014> Confounding: What it is and how to deal with it, 2008. A confounding variable can influence the outcome of an experiment in many ways, such as: A confounding variable may be known or unknown. They are often characterized as having an association or correlation with both the independent and dependent variables. Another characterization is that the confounding variable affects groups or observations differently. Confounding variables or confounders are often defined as the variables correlate (positively or negatively) with both the dependent variable and the independent variable. A Confounder is an extraneous variable whose presence affects the variables being studied so that the results do not reflect the actual relationship between the variables under study. <U+2014> How to control confounding effects by statistical analysis, 2012. The deeper difficulty of confounding variables is that it may not be obvious that they exist and are impacting results. The effects of confounding variables are often not obvious or even identifiable unless they are specifically addressed in the design of the experiment or data collection method. Confounding variables are traditionally a concern in applied statistics. This is because in statistics we are often concerned with the effect of independent variables on dependent variables in data. Statistical methods are designed to discover and describe these relationships and confounding variables can essentially corrupt or invalidate discoveries. Machine learning practitioners are typically interested in the skill of a predictive model and less concerned with the statistical correctness or interpretability of the model. As such, confounding variables are an important topic when it comes to data selection and preparation, but less important than they may be when developing descriptive statistical models. Nevertheless, confounding variables are critically important in applied machine learning. The evaluation of a machine learning model is an experiment with independent and dependent variables. As such, it is subject to confounding variables. What may be surprising is that you already know this and that the gold-standard practices in applied machine learning address this. Therefore, being intimately aware of the confounding variables in machine learning experiments is required to understand the choice and interpretation of machine learning model evaluation. Consider, what impacts the evaluation of a machine learning model, what are the independent variables? Some examples include: Each of these choices will impact the dependent variable in a machine learning experiment, which is the chosen metric used to estimate the skill of the model when making predictions. The evaluation of a machine learning model involves the design and execution of controlled experiments. A controlled experiment holds all elements constant except one element under study. The two most common types of controlled experiments in machine learning are: Nevertheless, there are confounding variables that the controlled experiments cannot hold constant. Specifically, there are sources of randomness, that if they were held constant would result in an invalid evaluation of the model. Three examples include: For example, weights in a neural network are initialized to random values. Stochastic gradient descent randomizes the order of samples in an epoch to vary the types of updates performed. Random subsets of features are selected for each possible cut point in random forest. And many more examples. Randomization in machine learning algorithms is not a bug; it is a feature intended to improve the performance of the model on average over classical deterministic methods. Randomness can be present in ML at many different levels, usually enhancing performance or alleviating problems and difficulties of classical methods. <U+2014> Randomized Machine Learning Approaches: Recent Developments and Challenges, 2017. These are confounding variables that we cannot hold constant. If they are held constant, the evaluation of the model will no longer provide insight into the generalizability of the result. We will know how well the model performs on a specific data sample or initialization of sequence of decisions during learning, but little idea on how the model will perform in general. The way that we can handle confounding variables that we cannot control is by using randomization. Randomization is a technique used in experimental design to give control over confounding variables that cannot (should not) be held constant. For example, randomization is used in clinical experiments to control-for the biological differences between individual human beings when evaluating a treatment. It is the reason why a treatment must be evaluated on multiple individuals rather than on a single individual before the findings can be generalized. In randomization the random assignment of study subjects to exposure categories to breaking any links between exposure and confounders. This reduces potential for confounding by generating groups that are fairly comparable with respect to known and unknown confounding variables. <U+2014> How to control confounding effects by statistical analysis, 2012. Randomization is a simple tool in experimental design that allows the confounding variables to have their effect across a sample. It shifts the experiment from looking at an individual case to a collection of observations, where statistical tools are used to interpret the finding. In medicine, randomization is the gold standard for evaluating a treatment and is called the randomized clinical trial. It is designed to remove not only the confounding effects of biological differences, but also the bias, such as the effect of the experimenter choosing the members of the treatment and non-treatment groups. You can imagine that a treatment would look very successful if the least-sick members of a cohort were chosen to be administered. An [Randomized clinical trial] is a special kind of cohort study, with the characteristic that patients are randomly assigned to the experimental group (with exposure) and the control group (without exposure). [¡¦] Therefore, randomization helps to prevent selection by the clinician, and helps to establish groups that are equal with respect to relevant prognostic factors. <U+2014> The randomized clinical trial: An unbeatable standard in clinical research?, 2007. There are still confounding variables when using a randomized clinical trial. An example is the case where the experimenters know what treatment participants of the study are receiving. This can impact the way the experimenters interact with the participants, which in turn can impact the results of the experiment. The answer is to use blinding where participants or experimenters do not know the treatment. Ideally, a double-blind experiment is adopted, ensuring that both participates and experimenters are unaware of their treatment. When feasible, it is strongly recommended that also after randomization, patients and clinicians do not know who receives the intervention and who does not. Studies may be single blind (either the patient or the clinician does not know who receives the treatment and who does not) or double blind (both the patient and the clinician do not know who receives the treatment). <U+2014> The randomized clinical trial: An unbeatable standard in clinical research?, 2007. Note, before we move on to look at the use of randomization in machine learning, consider that there are other approaches to managing the effect of confounding variables. Wikipedia has a good list here. Randomization is used in the evaluation of machine learning models to manage the uncontrollable confounding variables. It is key to the standard ways described for evaluating machine learning models and the rationale for using methods such as data resampling and repeating experiments. Randomization allows the machine learning practitioner to generalize a finding, to make it useful and applicable. It¡¯s the reason why careful design of the test harness and resampling method is important. It is the reason why we repeat the evaluation of a model and the reason we don¡¯t fix the seed on the pseudorandom number generator. I talk more about these topics in the posts: When we take a closer look at why we use randomization, to control for confounding variables, it raises questions about the other confounders that we may not be controlling for. For example, the machine learning practitioner knowing the skill of models prior to giving each model a chance to do its best via data preparation and hyperparameter tuning. Perhaps practitioners should blind themselves to remove the possibility of biasing the choice of final model. The risk is that the practitioner that really likes artificial neural networks will ¡°discover¡± a neural network configuration that outperforms other models. At best it is a statistical fluke or violation of Occam¡¯s Razor for a parsimonious solution to a predictive modeling project; at worst, it is scientific fraud. The reason that clinicians aggressively removed this bias is people¡¯s lives were at risk. We may get to that point with machine learning algorithms, e.g. in cars. In practice, today, I think this is good motivation for front-loading an experiment with a large and careful design and automating the execution and statistical interpretation of the results.

"mastery",2018-07-16,"All of Statistics for Machine Learning","https://machinelearningmastery.com/all-of-statistics-for-machine-learning/","A foundation in statistics is required to be effective as a machine learning practitioner. The book ¡°All of Statistics¡± was written specifically to provide a foundation in probability and statistics for computer science undergraduates that may have an interest in data mining and machine learning. As such, it is often recommended as a book to machine learning practitioners interested in expanding their understanding of statistics. In this post, you will discover the book ¡°All of Statistics¡±, the topics it covers, and a reading list intended for machine learning practitioners. After reading this post, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. All of Statistics for Machine LearningPhoto by Chris Sorge, some rights reserved. The book ¡°All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference¡± was written by Larry Wasserman and released in 2004. All of Statistics Wasserman is a professor of statistics and data science at Carnegie Mellon University. The book is ambitious. It seeks to quickly bring computer science students up-to-speed with probability and statistics. As such, the topics covered by the book are very broad, perhaps broader than the average introductory textbooks. Taken literally, the title ¡°All of Statistics¡± is an exaggeration. But in spirit, the title is apt, as the book does cover a much broader range of topics than a typical introductory book on mathematical statistics. This book is for people who want to learn probability and statistics quickly. <U+2014> Page vii, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, 2004. The book is not for the average practitioner; it is intended for computer science undergraduate students. It does assume some prior knowledge in calculus and linear algebra. If you don¡¯t like equations or mathematical notation, this book is not for you. Interestingly, Wasserman wrote the book in response to the rise of data mining and machine learning in computer science occurring outside of classical statistics. He asserts in the preface the importance of having a grounding in statistics in order to be effective in machine learning. Using fancy tools like neural nets, boosting, and support vector machines without understanding basic statistics is like doing brain surgery before knowing how to use a band-aid. <U+2014> Pages vii-viii, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, 2004. The material is presented in a very clear and concise manner. A systematic approach is taken with brief descriptions of a method, equations describing its implementation, and worked examples to motivate the use of the method with sample code in R. In fact, the material is so compact that it often reads like a series of encyclopedia examples. This is great if you want to know how to implement a method, but very challenging if you are new to the methods and seeking intuitions. Take my free 7-day email crash course now (with sample code). Click to sign-up and also get a free PDF Ebook version of the course. Download Your FREE Mini-Course The choice of topics covered by the book is very broad, as mentioned in the previous section. This is great on the one hand as the reader is given exposure to advanced subjects early on. The downside of this aggressive scope is that topics are touched on briefly with very little hand holding. You are left to re-read sections until you get it. Let¡¯s look at the topics covered by the book. This is helpful to both get an idea of the presented scope of the field and the context for the topics that may interest you as a machine learning practitioner. The book is divided into three parts; they are: The first part of the book focuses on probability theory and formal language for describing uncertainty. The second part is focused on statistical inference. The third part focuses on specific methods and problems raised in the second part. The book does have a reference or encyclopedia feeling. As such, there are a lot of chapters, but each chapter is reasonably standalone. The book is divided into 24 chapters; they are: The preface for the book provides a useful glossary of terms mapping them from statistics to computer science. This ¡°Statistics/Data Mining Dictionary¡± is reproduced below. Statistics/Data Mining DictionaryTaken from ¡°All of Statistics¡°. All of the R code and datasets used in the worked examples in the book are available from Wasserman¡¯s homepage. This is very helpful as you can focus on experimenting with the examples rather than typing in the code and hoping that you got the syntax correct. I would not recommend this book to developers who have not touched statistics before. It¡¯s too challenging. I would recommend this book to computer science students who are in math-learning-mode. I would also recommend it to machine learning practitioners with some previous background in statistics or a strong mathematical foundation. If you are comfortable with mathematical notation and you know what you¡¯re looking for, this book is an excellent reference. You can flip to the topic or the method and get a crisp presentation. The problem is, for a machine learning practitioner, you do need to know about many of these topics, just not at the level of detail presented. Perhaps a shade lighter, at the intuition level. If you are up to it, it would be worth reading (or skimming) the following chapters in order to build a solid foundation in probability for statistics: Again, these are important topics, but you require a concept-level understanding only. For coverage of statistical hypothesis tests that you may use to interpret data and compare the skill of models, the following chapters are recommended reading: I would also recommend the chapter on the Bootstrap. It¡¯s just a great method to have in your head, but with a focus for either better understanding bagging and random forest or as a procedure for estimating confidence intervals of model skill. Finally, a statistical approach is used to present machine learning algorithms. I would recommend these chapters if you prefer a more mathematical treatment of regression and classification algorithms: I can read the mathematical presentation of statistics, but I prefer intuitions and working code. I am less likely to pick up this book from my bookcase, in favor of gentler treatments such as ¡°Statistics in Plain English¡± or application focused treatments such as ¡°Empirical Methods for Artificial Intelligence¡°. Do you agree with this reading list?
