From meteorological measurements, such as wind speed and temperature, it is possible to forecast whether the ground ozone will be at a sufficiently high level tomorrow to issue a public air pollution warning. This is the basis behind a standard machine learning dataset used for time series classification dataset, called simply the ¡°ozone prediction problem¡°. This dataset describes meteorological observations over seven years in the Houston area and whether or not ozone levels were above a critical air pollution level, or not. In this tutorial, you will discover how to explore this data and to develop a probabilistic forecast model in order to predict air pollution in Houston, Texas. After completing this tutorial, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. How to Develop a Probabilistic Forecasting Model to Predict Air Pollution DaysPhoto by paramita, some rights reserved. This tutorial is divided into five parts; they are: Air pollution can be characterized as a high measure of ozone at the ground level, often characterized as ¡°bad ozone¡± to differentiate it from the ozone in the higher atmosphere. The ozone prediction problem is a time series classification prediction problem that involves predicting whether the next day will be a high air pollution day (ozone day) or not. The prediction of an ozone day can be used by meteorological organizations to warn the public such that they could take precautionary measures. The dataset was originally studied by Kun Zhang, et al. in their 2006 paper ¡°Forecasting Skewed Biased Stochastic Ozone Days: Analyses and Solutions,¡± then again in their follow-up paper ¡°Forecasting Skewed Biased Stochastic Ozone Days: analyses, solutions and beyond.¡± It is a challenging problem because the physical mechanisms that underlie high ozone levels are (or were not) completely understood, meaning that forecasts cannot be based on physical simulations as with other meteorological forecasts like temperature and rainfall. The dataset was used as the basis for developing predictive models that use a broad suite of variables that may or may not be relevant to predicting an ozone level, in addition to the few known to be relevant to the actual chemical processes involved. However, it is a common belief among environmental scientists that a significant large number of other features currently never explored yet are very likely useful in building highly accurate ozone prediction model. Yet, little is known on exactly what these features are and how they actually interact in the formation of ozone. [¡¦] none of today¡¯s environmental science knows as of yet how to use them. This provides a wonderful opportunities for data mining <U+2014> Forecasting Skewed Biased Stochastic Ozone Days: Analyses and Solutions, 2006. Forecasting a high level of ground ozone on a subsequent day is a challenging problem that is known to be stochastic in nature. This means that it is expected that there will be forecast errors. Therefore, it is desirable to model the prediction problem probabilistically and forecasting the probability of an ozone day or not given observations on the prior day or days. The dataset contains seven years of daily observations of meteorological variables (1998-2004 or 2,536 days) and whether there was an ozone day or not, taken in the Houston, Galveston, and Brazoria areas, Texas, USA. A total of 72 variables were observed each day, many of which are believed to be relevant to the prediction problem, and 10 of which have been confirmed to be relevant based on the physics. [¡¦] only about 10 features among these 72 features have been verified by environmental scientists to be useful and relevant, and there is neither empirical nor theoretical information as of yet on the relevance of the other 60 features. However, air quality control scientists have been speculating for a long time that some of these features might be useful, but just haven¡¯t been able to either develop the theory or use simulations to justify their relevance <U+2014> Forecasting Skewed Biased Stochastic Ozone Days: Analyses and Solutions, 2006. There are 24 variables that track the hourly wind speed and another 24 variables that track the temperature throughout each hour of the day. Two versions of the dataset are made available with different averaging periods for the measures, specifically 1-hourly and 8-hourly. What does appear to be missing and might be useful is the observed ozone for each day rather than the dichotomous ozone day/non-ozone day. Other measures used in the parametric model are also not available. Interestingly, a parametric ozone forecast model is used as a baseline, based on a description in ¡°Guideline For Developing An Ozone Forecasting Program,¡± 1999 EPA guideline. This document also describes standard methodological to verify ozone forecasting systems. In summary, it is a challenging prediction problem because: Take my free 7-day email crash course now (with sample code). Click to sign-up and also get a free PDF Ebook version of the course. Download Your FREE Mini-Course The dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning repository. We will only look at the 8-hour data in this tutorial. Download ¡°eighthr.data¡± and place it in your current working directory. Inspecting the data file, we can see observations with different scales. Skimming through the file, such as to the start of 2003, we can see that missing observations are marked with a ¡°?¡± value. First, we can load the data as a Pandas DataFrame using the read_csv() function. There is no data header and we can parse the dates in the first column and use them as an index; the complete example is listed below. Running the example confirms there are 2,534 days of data and 73 variables. We can also see the nature of the class imbalance where a little more than 93% of the days are non-ozone days and about 6% are ozone days. We can also create a line plot of the output variable over the seven years to get an idea if the ozone days occur at any particular time of year. Running the example creates a line plot of the output variable over seven years. We can see that there are clusters of ozone days in the middle of each year: the summer or warmer months in the northern hemisphere. Line plot of output variable over 7 years From briefly reviewing the observations, we can get some ideas of how we might prepare the data: We can perform some minimal data preparation. The example below loads the dataset, replaces the missing observations with 0.0, frames the data as a supervised learning problem (predict ozone tomorrow based on observations today), and splits the data into train and test sets, based on a rough number of days in two years. You could explore alternate approaches to replacing the missing values, such as imputing a mean value. Also, 2004 is a leap year, so the split of data into train and test sets is not a clean 5-2 year split, but is close enough for this tutorial. Running the example saves the train and test sets to CSV files and summarizes the shape of the two datasets. A naive model would predict the probability of an ozone day each day. This is a naive approach because it does not use any information other than the base rate of the event. In the verification of meteorological forecasts, this is called the climatological forecast. We can estimate the probability of an ozone day from the training dataset, as follows. We can then predict the naive probability of an ozone day for each day on the test dataset. Once we have a forecast, we can evaluate it. A useful measure for evaluating probabilistic forecast is the Brier score. This score can be thought of as the mean squared error of the predicted probabilities (e.g. 5%) from the expected probabilities (0% or 1%). It is the average of the errors made across each day in the test dataset. We are interested in minimizing the Brier score, smaller values are better, e.g. smaller error. We can evaluate the Brier score for a forecast using the brier_score_loss() function from the scikit-learn library. For a model to be skilful, it must have a score better than the score of the naive forecast. We can make this obvious by calculating a Brier Skill Score (BSS) that normalizes the Brier Score (BS) based on the naive forecast. We expect that the calculated BSS for the naive forecast would be 0.0. Going forward, we are interested in maximizing this score, e.g. larger BSS scores are better. The complete example for the naive forecast is listed below. Running the example, we can see the naive probability of an ozone day even is about 7.2%. Using the base rate as a forecast results in a Brier skill of 0.039 and the expected Brier Skill Score of 0.0 (ignore the sign). We are now ready to explore some machine learning methods to see if we can add skill to this forecast. Note that the original papers evaluated the skill of the approaches using precision and recall directly, a surprising approach for direct comparison between methods. Perhaps an alternative measure you could explore is the area under ROC curve (ROC AUC). Plotting ROC curves for final models would allow the operator of the model to choose a threshold that provides the desired level of balance between the true positive (hit) and false positive (false alarm) rates. The original paper reports some success with bagged decision trees. Though our choice of inductive learners are nonexhaustive, this paper has shown that inductive learning can be a method of choice for ozone level forecast, and ensemble-based probability trees provide better forecasts (higher recall and precision) than existing approaches. <U+2014> Forecasting Skewed Biased Stochastic Ozone Days: Analyses and Solutions, 2006. This is not surprising for a few reasons: This suggests a good place to start when testing machine learning algorithms on the problem. We can get started quickly by spot-checking the performance of a sample of standard ensemble tree methods from the scikit-learn library with their default configurations and the number of trees set to 100. Specifically, the methods: First, we must split the train and test datasets into input (X) and output (y) components so that we can fit sklearn models. We also require the Brier Score for the naive forecast so that we can correctly calculate the Brier Skill Scores for the new models. We can evaluate the skill of a single scikit-learn model generically. Below defines the function named evaluate_once() that fits and evaluates a given defined and configured scikit-learn model and returns the Brier Skill Score (BSS). Ensemble trees are a stochastic machine learning method. This means that they will make different predictions when the same configuration of the same model is trained on the same data. To correct for this, we can evaluate a given model multiple times, such as 10 times, and calculate the average skill across each of these runs. The function below will evaluate a given model 10 times, print the average BSS score, and return the population of scores for analysis. We are now ready to evaluate a suite of ensemble decision tree algorithms. The complete example is listed below. Running the example summarizes the average BSS for each model averaged across 10 runs. Given the stochastic nature of the algorithms, your specific results may differ, but the trends should be the same. From the mean BSS scores, it suggests that extra trees, stochastic gradient boosting, and random forest models are the most skillful. A box and whisker plot of the scores for each model is plotted. All of the models on all of their runs showed skill over the naive forecast (positive scores), which is very encouraging. The distribution of the BSS scores for Extra Trees, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest all look encouraging. Box and whisker plot of ensemble decision tree BSS scores on the test set Given that stochastic gradient boosting looks promising, it is worth exploring whether the performance of the model can be further lifted through some parameter tuning. There are many parameters to tune with the model, but some good heuristics for tuning the model include: Rather than grid searching values, we can spot check some arguments based on these principles. You can explore grid searching of these parameters yourself if you have the time and computational resources. We will compare four configurations of the GBM model: The complete example is listed below. Running the example prints the BSS for each model averaged across 10 runs for each configuration. The results suggest that the change to the learning rate and number of trees alone introduced some lift over the default configuration. The results also show that the ¡®all¡¯ configuration that included each change resulted in the best mean BSS. Box and whisker plots of the BSS scores from each configuration are created. We can see that the configuration that included all the changes was dramatically better than the baseline model and the other configuration combinations. Perhaps even further gains are possible with fine tuned arguments to the model. Box and whisker plot of tuned GBM models showing BSS scores on the test set It would be interesting to get a hold of the parametric model described in the paper and the data required to use it in order to compare its skill to the skill of this final model.

"mastery",2018-09-05,"A Gentle Introduction to Probability Scoring Methods in Python","https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-score-probability-predictions-in-python/","Predicting probabilities instead of class labels for a classification problem can provide additional nuance and uncertainty for the predictions. The added nuance allows more sophisticated metrics to be used to interpret and evaluate the predicted probabilities. In general, methods for the evaluation of the accuracy of predicted probabilities are referred to as scoring rules or scoring functions. In this tutorial, you will discover three scoring methods that you can use to evaluate the predicted probabilities on your classification predictive modeling problem. After completing this tutorial, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. A Gentle Introduction to Probability Scoring Methods in PythonPhoto by Paul Balfe, some rights reserved. This tutorial is divided into four parts; they are: Log loss, also called ¡°logistic loss,¡± ¡°logarithmic loss,¡± or ¡°cross entropy¡± can be used as a measure for evaluating predicted probabilities. Each predicted probability is compared to the actual class output value (0 or 1) and a score is calculated that penalizes the probability based on the distance from the expected value. The penalty is logarithmic, offering a small score for small differences (0.1 or 0.2) and enormous score for a large difference (0.9 or 1.0). A model with perfect skill has a log loss score of 0.0. In order to summarize the skill of a model using log loss, the log loss is calculated for each predicted probability, and the average loss is reported. The log loss can be implemented in Python using the log_loss() function in scikit-learn. For example: In the binary classification case, the function takes a list of true outcome values and a list of probabilities as arguments and calculates the average log loss for the predictions. We can make a single log loss score concrete with an example. Given a specific known outcome of 0, we can predict values of 0.0 to 1.0 in 0.01 increments (101 predictions) and calculate the log loss for each. The result is a curve showing how much each prediction is penalized as the probability gets further away from the expected value. We can repeat this for a known outcome of 1 and see the same curve in reverse. The complete example is listed below. Running the example creates a line plot showing the loss scores for probability predictions from 0.0 to 1.0 for both the case where the true label is 0 and 1. This helps to build an intuition for the effect that the loss score has when evaluating predictions. Line Plot of Evaluating Predictions with Log Loss Model skill is reported as the average log loss across the predictions in a test dataset. As an average, we can expect that the score will be suitable with a balanced dataset and misleading when there is a large imbalance between the two classes in the test set. This is because predicting 0 or small probabilities will result in a small loss. We can demonstrate this by comparing the distribution of loss values when predicting different constant probabilities for a balanced and an imbalanced dataset. First, the example below predicts values from 0.0 to 1.0 in 0.1 increments for a balanced dataset of 50 examples of class 0 and 1. Running the example, we can see that a model is better-off predicting probabilities values that are not sharp (close to the edge) and are back towards the middle of the distribution. The penalty of being wrong with a sharp probability is very large. Line Plot of Predicting Log Loss for Balanced Dataset We can repeat this experiment with an imbalanced dataset with a 10:1 ratio of class 0 to class 1. Here, we can see that a model that is skewed towards predicting very small probabilities will perform well, optimistically so. The naive model that predicts a constant probability of 0.1 will be the baseline model to beat. The result suggests that model skill evaluated with log loss should be interpreted carefully in the case of an imbalanced dataset, perhaps adjusted relative to the base rate for class 1 in the dataset. Line Plot of Predicting Log Loss for Imbalanced Dataset The Brier score, named for Glenn Brier, calculates the mean squared error between predicted probabilities and the expected values. The score summarizes the magnitude of the error in the probability forecasts. The error score is always between 0.0 and 1.0, where a model with perfect skill has a score of 0.0. Predictions that are further away from the expected probability are penalized, but less severely as in the case of log loss. The skill of a model can be summarized as the average Brier score across all probabilities predicted for a test dataset. The Brier score can be calculated in Python using the brier_score_loss() function in scikit-learn. It takes the true class values (0, 1) and the predicted probabilities for all examples in a test dataset as arguments and returns the average Brier score. For example: We can evaluate the impact of prediction errors by comparing the Brier score for single probability forecasts in increasing error from 0.0 to 1.0. The complete example is listed below. Running the example creates a plot of the probability prediction error in absolute terms (x-axis) to the calculated Brier score (y axis). We can see a familiar quadratic curve, increasing from 0 to 1 with the squared error. Line Plot of Evaluating Predictions with Brier Score Model skill is reported as the average Brier across the predictions in a test dataset. As with log loss, we can expect that the score will be suitable with a balanced dataset and misleading when there is a large imbalance between the two classes in the test set. We can demonstrate this by comparing the distribution of loss values when predicting different constant probabilities for a balanced and an imbalanced dataset. First, the example below predicts values from 0.0 to 1.0 in 0.1 increments for a balanced dataset of 50 examples of class 0 and 1. Running the example, we can see that a model is better-off predicting middle of the road probabilities values like 0.5. Unlike log loss that is quite flat for close probabilities, the parabolic shape shows the clear quadratic increase in the score penalty as the error is increased. Line Plot of Predicting Brier Score for Balanced Dataset We can repeat this experiment with an imbalanced dataset with a 10:1 ratio of class 0 to class 1. Running the example, we see a very different picture for the imbalanced dataset. Like the average log loss, the average Brier score will present optimistic scores on an imbalanced dataset, rewarding small prediction values that reduce error on the majority class. In these cases, Brier score should be compared relative to the naive prediction (e.g. the base rate of the minority class or 0.1 in the above example) or normalized by the naive score. This latter example is common and is called the Brier Skill Score (BSS). Where BS is the Brier skill of model, and BS_ref is the Brier skill of the naive prediction. The Brier Skill Score reports the relative skill of the probability prediction over the naive forecast. A good update to the scikit-learn API would be to add a parameter to the brier_score_loss() to support the calculation of the Brier Skill Score. Line Plot of Predicting Brier Score for Imbalanced Dataset A predicted probability for a binary (two-class) classification problem can be interpreted with a threshold. The threshold defines the point at which the probability is mapped to class 0 versus class 1, where the default threshold is 0.5. Alternate threshold values allow the model to be tuned for higher or lower false positives and false negatives. Tuning the threshold by the operator is particularly important on problems where one type of error is more or less important than another or when a model is makes disproportionately more or less of a specific type of error. The Receiver Operating Characteristic, or ROC, curve is a plot of the true positive rate versus the false positive rate for the predictions of a model for multiple thresholds between 0.0 and 1.0. Predictions that have no skill for a given threshold are drawn on the diagonal of the plot from the bottom left to the top right. This line represents no-skill predictions for each threshold. Models that have skill have a curve above this diagonal line that bows towards the top left corner. Below is an example of fitting a logistic regression model on a binary classification problem and calculating and plotting the ROC curve for the predicted probabilities on a test set of 500 new data instances. Running the example creates an example of a ROC curve that can be compared to the no skill line on the main diagonal. Example ROC Curve The integrated area under the ROC curve, called AUC or ROC AUC, provides a measure of the skill of the model across all evaluated thresholds. An AUC score of 0.5 suggests no skill, e.g. a curve along the diagonal, whereas an AUC of 1.0 suggests perfect skill, all points along the left y-axis and top x-axis toward the top left corner. An AUC of 0.0 suggests perfectly incorrect predictions. Predictions by models that have a larger area have better skill across the thresholds, although the specific shape of the curves between models will vary, potentially offering opportunity to optimize models by a pre-chosen threshold. Typically, the threshold is chosen by the operator after the model has been prepared. The AUC can be calculated in Python using the roc_auc_score() function in scikit-learn. This function takes a list of true output values and predicted probabilities as arguments and returns the ROC AUC. For example: An AUC score is a measure of the likelihood that the model that produced the predictions will rank a randomly chosen positive example above a randomly chosen negative example. Specifically, that the probability will be higher for a real event (class=1) than a real non-event (class=0). This is an instructive definition that offers two important intuitions: Below, the example demonstrating the ROC curve is updated to calculate and display the AUC. Running the example calculates and prints the ROC AUC for the logistic regression model evaluated on 500 new examples. An important consideration in choosing the ROC AUC is that it does not summarize the specific discriminative power of the model, rather the general discriminative power across all thresholds. It might be a better tool for model selection rather than in quantifying the practical skill of a model¡¯s predicted probabilities. Predicted probabilities can be tuned to improve or even game a performance measure. For example, the log loss and Brier scores quantify the average amount of error in the probabilities. As such, predicted probabilities can be tuned to improve these scores in a few ways: Generally, it may be useful to review the calibration of the probabilities using tools like a reliability diagram. This can be achieved using the calibration_curve() function in scikit-learn. Some algorithms, such as SVM and neural networks, may not predict calibrated probabilities natively. In these cases, the probabilities can be calibrated and in turn may improve the chosen metric. Classifiers can be calibrated in scikit-learn using the CalibratedClassifierCV class. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this tutorial, you discovered three metrics that you can use to evaluate the predicted probabilities on your classification predictive modeling problem.

I did this by calculating the naive score by applying Brier to the fraction of winners in the data set which is 0.1055 or 10.55%. Using this with the Brier skill score formula and the raw Brier score I get a BSS of 0.0117 This is better than zero which is good but how good ? To be a valid score of model performance, you would calculate the score for all forecasts in a period. Yes I calculated the Brier base score for 0.1055 and then I calculated the Brier score for all my ratings thats 49,277 of them Thank for this, Jason.  I noticed something strange with the Brier score:brier_score_loss([1], [1], pos_label=1) returns 1 instead of 0.brier_score_loss([1], [0], pos_label=1) returns 0 instead of 1. Looking into the source code, it seems that brier_score_loss breaks like this only when y_true contains a single unique class (like [1]). This stems from a bug that is already reported here:https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9300  A quick workaround for your code would be to replace this line:
losses = [brier_score_loss([1], [x], pos_label=[1]) for x in yhat] with the following:
losses = [2 * brier_score_loss([0, 1], [0, x], pos_label=[1]) for x in yhat] Interesting. I guess it might not make much sense to evaluate a single forecast using Brier. Brier score should be applicable for any number of forecasts.
Having a bug in sklearn shouldn¡¯t change that. <U+0001F642> ¡®An AUC score of 0.0 suggests no skill¡¯ <U+2013> here it should be 0.5 AUC, right? 0.0 would mean a perfect skill you just need to invert the classes.

"mastery",2018-09-03,"How and When to Use a Calibrated Classification Model with scikit-learn","https://machinelearningmastery.com/calibrated-classification-model-in-scikit-learn/","Instead of predicting class values directly for a classification problem, it can be convenient to predict the probability of an observation belonging to each possible class. Predicting probabilities allows some flexibility including deciding how to interpret the probabilities, presenting predictions with uncertainty, and providing more nuanced ways to evaluate the skill of the model. Predicted probabilities that match the expected distribution of probabilities for each class are referred to as calibrated. The problem is, not all machine learning models are capable of predicting calibrated probabilities. There are methods to both diagnose how calibrated predicted probabilities are and to better calibrate the predicted probabilities with the observed distribution of each class. Often, this can lead to better quality predictions, depending on how the skill of the model is evaluated. In this tutorial, you will discover the importance of calibrating predicted probabilities and how to diagnose and improve the calibration of models used for probabilistic classification. After completing this tutorial, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. How and When to Use a Calibrated Classification Model with scikit-learnPhoto by Nigel Howe, some rights reserved. This tutorial is divided into four parts; they are: A classification predictive modeling problem requires predicting or forecasting a label for a given observation. An alternative to predicting the label directly, a model may predict the probability of an observation belonging to each possible class label. This provides some flexibility both in the way predictions are interpreted and presented (choice of threshold and prediction uncertainty) and in the way the model is evaluated. Although a model may be able to predict probabilities, the distribution and behavior of the probabilities may not match the expected distribution of observed probabilities in the training data. This is especially common with complex nonlinear machine learning algorithms that do not directly make probabilistic predictions and instead use approximations. The distribution of the probabilities can be adjusted to better match the expected distribution observed in the data. This adjustment is referred to as calibration, as in the calibration of the model or the calibration of the distribution of class probabilities. [¡¦] we desire that the estimated class probabilities are reflective of the true underlying probability of the sample. That is, the predicted class probability (or probability-like value) needs to be well-calibrated. To be well-calibrated, the probabilities must effectively reflect the true likelihood of the event of interest. <U+2014> Page 249, Applied Predictive Modeling, 2013. There are two concerns in calibrating probabilities; they are diagnosing the calibration of predicted probabilities and the calibration process itself. A reliability diagram is a line plot of the relative frequency of what was observed (y-axis) versus the predicted probability frequency<U+00A0> (x-axis). Reliability diagrams are common aids for illustrating the properties of probabilistic forecast systems. They consist of a plot of the observed relative frequency against the predicted probability, providing a quick visual intercomparison when tuning probabilistic forecast systems, as well as documenting the performance of the final product <U+2014> Increasing the Reliability of Reliability Diagrams, 2007. Specifically, the predicted probabilities are divided up into a fixed number of buckets along the x-axis. The number of events (class=1) are then counted for each bin (e.g. the relative observed frequency). Finally, the counts are normalized. The results are then plotted as a line plot. These plots are commonly referred to as ¡®reliability¡® diagrams in forecast literature, although may also be called ¡®calibration¡® plots or curves as they summarize how well the forecast probabilities are calibrated. The better calibrated or more reliable a forecast, the closer the points will appear along the main diagonal from the bottom left to the top right of the plot. The position of the points or the curve relative to the diagonal can help to interpret the probabilities; for example: Probabilities, by definition, are continuous, so we expect some separation from the line, often shown as an S-shaped curve showing pessimistic tendencies over-forecasting low probabilities and under-forecasting high probabilities. Reliability diagrams provide a diagnostic to check whether the forecast value Xi is reliable. Roughly speaking, a probability forecast is reliable if the event actually happens with an observed relative frequency consistent with the forecast value. <U+2014> Increasing the Reliability of Reliability Diagrams, 2007. The reliability diagram can help to understand the relative calibration of the forecasts from different predictive models. The predictions made by a predictive model can be calibrated. Calibrated predictions may (or may not) result in an improved calibration on a reliability diagram. Some algorithms are fit in such a way that their predicted probabilities are already calibrated. Without going into details why, logistic regression is one such example. Other algorithms do not directly produce predictions of probabilities, and instead a prediction of probabilities must be approximated. Some examples include neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees. The predicted probabilities from these methods will likely be uncalibrated and may benefit from being modified via calibration. Calibration of prediction probabilities is a rescaling operation that is applied after the predictions have been made by a predictive model. There are two popular approaches to calibrating probabilities; they are the Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression. Platt Scaling is simpler and is suitable for reliability diagrams with the S-shape. Isotonic Regression is more complex, requires a lot more data (otherwise it may overfit), but can support reliability diagrams with different shapes (is nonparametric). Platt Scaling is most effective when the distortion in the predicted probabilities is sigmoid-shaped. Isotonic Regression is a more powerful calibration method that can correct any monotonic distortion. Unfortunately, this extra power comes at a price. A learning curve analysis shows that Isotonic Regression is more prone to overfitting, and thus performs worse than Platt Scaling, when data is scarce. <U+2014> Predicting Good Probabilities With Supervised Learning, 2005. Note, and this is really important: better calibrated probabilities may or may not lead to better class-based or probability-based predictions. It really depends on the specific metric used to evaluate predictions. In fact, some empirical results suggest that the algorithms that can benefit the more from calibrating predicted probabilities include SVMs, bagged decision trees, and random forests. [¡¦] after calibration the best methods are boosted trees, random forests and SVMs. <U+2014> Predicting Good Probabilities With Supervised Learning, 2005. The scikit-learn machine learning library allows you to both diagnose the probability calibration of a classifier and calibrate a classifier that can predict probabilities. You can diagnose the calibration of a classifier by creating a reliability diagram of the actual probabilities versus the predicted probabilities on a test set. In scikit-learn, this is called a calibration curve. This can be implemented by first calculating the calibration_curve() function. This function takes the true class values for a dataset and the predicted probabilities for the main class (class=1). The function returns the true probabilities for each bin and the predicted probabilities for each bin. The number of bins can be specified via the n_bins argument and default to 5. For example, below is a code snippet showing the API usage: A classifier can be calibrated in scikit-learn using the CalibratedClassifierCV class. There are two ways to use this class: prefit and cross-validation. You can fit a model on a training dataset and calibrate this prefit model using a hold out validation dataset. For example, below is a code snippet showing the API usage: Alternately, the CalibratedClassifierCV can fit multiple copies of the model using k-fold cross-validation and calibrate the probabilities predicted by these models using the hold out set. Predictions are made using each of the trained models. For example, below is a code snippet showing the API usage: The CalibratedClassifierCV class supports two types of probability calibration; specifically, the parametric ¡®sigmoid¡® method (Platt¡¯s method) and the nonparametric ¡®isotonic¡® method which can be specified via the ¡®method¡® argument. We can make the discussion of calibration concrete with some worked examples. In these examples, we will fit a support vector machine (SVM) to a noisy binary classification problem and use the model to predict probabilities, then review the calibration using a reliability diagram and calibrate the classifier and review the result. SVM is a good candidate model to calibrate because it does not natively predict probabilities, meaning the probabilities are often uncalibrated. A note on SVM: probabilities can be predicted by calling the decision_function() function on the fit model instead of the usual predict_proba() function. The probabilities are not normalized, but can be normalized when calling the calibration_curve() function by setting the ¡®normalize¡® argument to ¡®True¡®. The example below fits an SVM model on the test problem, predicted probabilities, and plots the calibration of the probabilities as a reliability diagram, Running the example creates a reliability diagram showing the calibration of the SVMs predicted probabilities (solid line) compared to a perfectly calibrated model along the diagonal of the plot (dashed line.) We can see the expected S-shaped curve of a conservative forecast. Uncalibrated SVM Reliability Diagram We can update the example to fit the SVM via the CalibratedClassifierCV class using 5-fold cross-validation, using the holdout sets to calibrate the predicted probabilities. The complete example is listed below. Running the example creates a reliability diagram for the calibrated probabilities. The shape of the calibrated probabilities is different, hugging the diagonal line much better, although still under-forecasting in the upper quadrant. Visually, the plot suggests a better calibrated model. Calibrated SVM Reliability Diagram We can make the contrast between the two models more obvious by including both reliability diagrams on the same plot. The complete example is listed below. Running the example creates a single reliability diagram showing both the calibrated (orange) and uncalibrated (blue) probabilities. It is not really an apples-to-apples comparison as the predictions made by the calibrated model are in fact a combination of five submodels. Nevertheless, we do see a marked difference in the reliability of the calibrated probabilities (very likely caused by the calibration process). Calibrated and Uncalibrated SVM Reliability Diagram This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this tutorial, you discovered the importance of calibrating predicted probabilities and how to diagnose and improve the calibration of models used for probabilistic classification. Specifically, you learned: Do you have any questions?
