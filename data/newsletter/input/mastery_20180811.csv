This is a common situation; far more common than most people think. The problem can be reasonably well defined: So how do you tackle this problem? Unless you have been through this trial by fire, you may struggle. In all of these cases, you will benefit from working through the problem carefully and systematically. In this post, I want to give you a specific and actionable procedure that you can use to work through your time series forecasting problem. Let¡¯s get started. How to Develop a Skilful Time Series Forecasting ModelPhoto by Make it Kenya, some rights reserved. The goal of this process is to get a ¡°good enough¡± forecast model as fast as possible. This process may or may not deliver the best possible model, but it will deliver a good model: a model that is better than a baseline prediction, if such a model exists. Typically, this process will deliver a model that is 80% to 90% of what can be achieved on the problem. The process is fast. As such, it focuses on automation. Hyperparameters are searched rather than specified based on careful analysis. You are encouraged to test suites of models in parallel, rapidly getting an idea of what works and what doesn¡¯t. Nevertheless, the process is flexible, allowing you to circle back or go as deep as you like on a given step if you have the time and resources. This process is divided into four parts; they are: You will notice that the process is different from a classical linear work-through of a predictive modeling problem. This is because it is designed to get a working forecast model fast and then slow down and see if you can get a better model. What is your process for working through a new time series forecasting problem?
Share it below in the comments. The biggest mistake is skipping steps. For example, the mistake that almost all beginners make is going straight to modeling without a strong idea of what problem is being solved or how to robustly evaluate candidate solutions. This almost always results in a lot of wasted time. Slow down, follow the process, and complete each step. I recommend having separate code for each experiment that can be re-run at any time. This is important so that you can circle back when you discover a bug, fix the code, and re-run an experiment. You are running experiments and iterating quickly, but if you are sloppy, then you cannot trust any of your results. This is especially important when it comes to the design of your test harness for evaluating candidate models. Let¡¯s take a closer look at each step of the process. Define your time series problem. Some topics to consider and motivating questions within each topic are as follows: Answer each question even if you have to estimate or guess. Some useful tools to help get answers include: Update your answers to these questions as you learn more. Design a test harness that you can use to evaluate candidate models. This includes both the method used to estimate model skill and the metric used to evaluate predictions. Below is a common time series forecasting model evaluation scheme if you are looking for ideas: The test harness must be robust and you must have complete trust in the results it provides. An important consideration is to ensure that any coefficients used for data preparation are estimated from the training dataset only and then applied on the test set. This might include mean and standard deviation in the case of data standardization. Test many models using your test harness. I recommend carefully designing experiments to test a suite of configurations for standard models and letting them run. Each experiment can record results to a file, to allow you to quickly discover the top three to five most skilful configurations from each run. Some common classes of methods that you can design experiments around include the following: This list is based on a univariate time series forecasting problem, but you can adapt it for the specifics of your problem, e.g. use VAR/VARMA/etc. in the case of multivariate time series forecasting. Slot in more of your favorite classical time series forecasting methods and machine learning methods as you see fit. Order here is important and is structured in increasing complexity from classical to modern methods. Early approaches are simple and give good results fast; later approaches are slower and more complex, but also have a higher bar to clear to be skillful. The resulting model skill can be used in a ratchet. For example, the skill of the best persistence configuration provide a baseline skill that all other models must outperform. If an autoregression model does better than persistence, it becomes the new level to outperform in order for a method to be considered skilful. Ideally, you want to exhaust each level before moving on to the next. E.g. get the most out of Autoregression methods and use the results as a new baseline to define ¡°skilful¡± before moving on to Exponential Smoothing methods. I put deep learning at the end as generally neural networks are poor at time series forecasting, but there is still a lot of room for improvement and experimentation in this area. The more time and resources that you have, the more configurations that you can evaluate. For example, with more time and resources, you could: I also encourage you to include data preparation schemes as hyperparameters for model runs. Some methods will perform some basic data preparation, such as differencing in ARIMA, nevertheless, it is often unclear exactly what data preparation schemes or combinations of schemes are required to best present a dataset to a modeling algorithm. Rather than guess, grid search and decide based on real results. Some data preparation schemes to consider include: So much searching can be slow. Some ideas to speed up the evaluation of models include: At the end of the previous time step, you know whether your time series is predictable. If it is predictable, you will have a list of the top 5 to 10 candidate models that are skillful on the problem. You can pick one or multiple models and finalize them. This involves training a new final model on all available historical data (train and test). The model is ready for use; for example: If you have time, you can always circle back to the previous step and see if you can further improve upon the final model. This may be required periodically if the data changes significantly over time. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered a simple four-step process that you can use to quickly discover a skilful predictive model for your time series forecasting problem. Did you find this process useful?

"mastery",2018-08-08,"Taxonomy of Time Series Forecasting Problems","https://machinelearningmastery.com/taxonomy-of-time-series-forecasting-problems/","The choice that you make directly impacts each step of the project from the design of a test harness to evaluate forecast models to the fundamental difficulty of the forecast problem that you are working on. It is possible to very quickly narrow down the options by working through a series of questions about your time series forecasting problem. By considering a few themes and questions within each theme, you narrow down the type of problem, test harness, and even choice of algorithms for your project. In this post, you will discover a framework that you can use to quickly understand and frame your time series forecasting problem. Let¡¯s get started. Taxonomy of Time Series Forecasting ProblemsPhoto by Adam Meek, some rights reserved. Time series forecasting involves developing and using a predictive model on data where there is an ordered relationship between observations. You can learn more about what time series forecasting is in this post: Before you get started on your project, you can answer a few questions and greatly improve your understanding of the structure of your forecast problem, the structure of the model requires, and how to evaluate it. The framework presented in this post is divided into seven parts; they are: I recommend working through this framework before starting any time series forecasting project. Your answers may not be crisp on the first time through and the questions may require to you study the data, the domain, and talk to experts and stakeholders. Update your answers as you learn more as it will help to keep you on track, avoid distractions, and develop the actual model that you need for your project. Generally, a prediction problem involves using past observations to predict or forecast one or more possible future observations. The goal is to guess about what might happen in the future. When you are required to make a forecast, it is critical to think about the data that you will have available to make the forecast and what you will be guessing about the future. We can summarize this as what are the inputs and outputs of the model when making a single forecast. The input data is not the data used to train the model. We are not at that point yet. It is the data used to make one forecast, for example the last seven days of sales data to forecast the next one day of sales data. Defining the inputs and outputs of the model forces you to think about what exactly is or may be required to make a forecast. You may not be able to be specific when it comes to input data. For example, you may not know whether one or multiple prior time steps are required to make a forecast. But you will be able to identify the variables that could be used to make a forecast. What are the inputs and outputs for a forecast? The input data can be further subdivided in order to better understand its relationship to the output variable. An input variable is endogenous if it is affected by other variables in the system and the output variable depends on it. In a time series, the observations for an input variable depend upon one another. For example, the observation at time t is dependent upon the observation at t-1; t-1 may depend on t-2, and so on. An input variable is an exogenous variable if it is independent of other variables in the system and the output variable depends upon it. Put simply, endogenous variables are influenced by other variables in the system (including themselves) whereas as exogenous variables are not and are considered as outside the system. Typically, a time series forecasting problem has endogenous variables (e.g. the output is a function of some number of prior time steps) and may or may not have exogenous variables. Often, exogenous variables are ignored given the strong focus on the time series. Explicitly thinking about both variable types may help to identify easily overlooked exogenous data or even engineered features that may improve the model. What are the endogenous and exogenous variables? Regression predictive modeling problems are those where a quantity is predicted. A quantity is a numerical value; for example a price, a count, a volume, and so on. A time series forecasting problem in which you want to predict one or more future numerical values is a regression type predictive modeling problem. Classification predictive modeling problems are those where a category is predicted. A category is a label from a small well-defined set of labels; for example {¡°hot¡±, ¡°cold¡±}, {¡°up¡±, ¡°down¡±}, and {¡°buy¡±, ¡°sell¡±} are categories. A time series forecasting problem in which you want to classify input time series data is a classification type predictive modeling problem. Are you working on a regression or classification predictive modeling problem? There is some flexibility between these types. For example, a regression problem can be reframed as classification and a classification problem can be reframed as regression. Some problems, like predicting an ordinal value, can be framed as either classification and regression. It is possible that a reframing of your time series forecasting problem may simplify it. What are some alternate ways to frame your time series forecasting problem? It is useful to plot each variable in a time series and inspect the plot looking for possible patterns. A time series for a single variable may not have any obvious pattern. We can think of a series with no pattern as unstructured, as in there is no discernible time-dependent structure. Alternately, a time series may have obvious patterns, such as a trend or seasonal cycles as structured. We can often simplify the modeling process by identifying and removing the obvious structures from the data, such as an increasing trend or repeating cycle. Some classical methods even allow you to specify parameters to handle these systematic structures directly. Are the time series variables unstructured or structured? A single variable measured over time is referred to as a univariate time series. Univariate means one variate or one variable. Multiple variables measured over time is referred to as a multivariate time series: multiple variates or multiple variables. Are you working on a univariate or multivariate time series problem? Considering this question with regard to inputs and outputs may add a further distinction. The number of variables may differ between the inputs and outputs, e.g. the data may not be symmetrical. For example, you may have multiple variables as input to the model and only be interested in predicting one of the variables as output. In this case, there is an assumption in the model that the multiple input variables aid and are required in predicting the single output variable. A forecast problem that requires a prediction of the next time step is called a one-step forecast model. Whereas a forecast problem that requires a prediction of more than one time step is called a multi-step forecast model. The more time steps to be projected into the future, the more challenging the problem given the compounding nature of the uncertainty on each forecasted time step. Do you require a single-step or a multi-step forecast? It is possible to develop a model once and use it repeatedly to make predictions. Given that the model is not updated or changed between forecasts, we can think of this model as being static. Conversely, we may receive new observations prior to making a subsequent forecast that could be used to create a new model or update the existing model. We can think of developing a new or updated model prior to each forecasts as a dynamic problem. For example, it if the problem requires a forecast at the beginning of the week for the week ahead, we may receive the true observation at the end of the week that we can use to update the model prior to making next weeks forecast. This would be a dynamic model. If we do not get a true observation at the end of the week or we do and choose to not re-fit the model, this would be a static model. We may prefer a dynamic model, but the constraints of the domain or limitations of a chosen algorithm may impose constraints that make this intractable. Do you require a static or a dynamically updated model? A time series where the observations are uniform over time may be described as contiguous. Many time series problems have contiguous observations, such as one observation each hour, day, month or year. A time series where the observations are not uniform over time may be described as discontiguous. The lack of uniformity of the observations may be caused by missing or corrupt values. It may also be a feature of the problem where observations are only made available sporadically or at increasingly or decreasingly spaced time intervals. In the case of non-uniform observations, specific data formatting may be required when fitting some models to make the observations uniform over time. Are your observations contiguous or discontiguous? This section lists some resources for further reading. To review, the themes and questions you can ask about your problem are as follows: Did you find this framework useful for your time series forecasting problem?

"mastery",2018-08-06,"11 Classical Time Series Forecasting Methods in Python (Cheat Sheet)","https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-methods-in-python-cheat-sheet/","Before exploring machine learning methods for time series, it is a good idea to ensure you have exhausted classical linear time series forecasting methods. Classical time series forecasting methods may be focused on linear relationships, nevertheless, they are sophisticated and perform well on a wide range of problems, assuming that your data is suitably prepared and the method is well configured. In this post, will you will discover a suite of classical methods for time series forecasting that you can test on your forecasting problem prior to exploring to machine learning methods. The post is structured as a cheat sheet to give you just enough information on each method to get started with a working code example and where to look to get more information on the method. All code examples are in Python and use the Statsmodels library. The APIs for this library can be tricky for beginners (trust me!), so having a working code example as a starting point will greatly accelerate your progress. This is a large post; you may want to bookmark it. Let¡¯s get started. 11 Classical Time Series Forecasting Methods in Python (Cheat Sheet)Photo by Ron Reiring, some rights reserved. This cheat sheet demonstrates 11 different classical time series forecasting methods; they are: Did I miss your favorite classical time series forecasting method?
Let me know in the comments below. Each method is presented in a consistent manner. This includes: Each code example is demonstrated on a simple contrived dataset that may or may not be appropriate for the method. Replace the contrived dataset with your data in order to test the method. Remember: each method will require tuning to your specific problem. In many cases, I have examples of how to configure and even grid search parameters on the blog already, try the search function. If you find this cheat sheet useful, please let me know in the comments below. The autoregression (AR) method models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the observations at prior time steps. The notation for the model involves specifying the order of the model p as a parameter to the AR function, e.g. AR(p). For example, AR(1) is a first-order autoregression model. The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components. The moving average (MA) method models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the residual errors from a mean process at prior time steps. A moving average model is different from calculating the moving average of the time series. The notation for the model involves specifying the order of the model q as a parameter to the MA function, e.g. MA(q). For example, MA(1) is a first-order moving average model. The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components. We can use the ARMA class to create an MA model and setting a zeroth-order AR model. We must specify the order of the MA model in the order argument. The Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) method models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the observations and resiudal errors at prior time steps. It combines both Autoregression (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models. The notation for the model involves specifying the order for the AR(p) and MA(q) models as parameters to an ARMA function, e.g. ARMA(p, q). An ARIMA model can be used to develop AR or MA models. The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the differenced observations and residual errors at prior time steps. It combines both Autoregression (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models as well as a differencing pre-processing step of the sequence to make the sequence stationary, called integration (I). The notation for the model involves specifying the order for the AR(p), I(d), and MA(q) models as parameters to an ARIMA function, e.g. ARIMA(p, d, q). An ARIMA model can also be used to develop AR, MA, and ARMA models. The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and without seasonal components. The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) method models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the differenced observations, errors, differenced seasonal observations, and seasonal errors at prior time steps. It combines the ARIMA model with the ability to perform the same autoregression, differencing, and moving average modeling at the seasonal level. The notation for the model involves specifying the order for the AR(p), I(d), and MA(q) models as parameters to an ARIMA function and AR(P), I(D), MA(Q) and m parameters at the seasonal level, e.g. SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q)m where ¡°m¡± is the number of time steps in each season (the seasonal period). A SARIMA model can be used to develop AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA models. The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and/or seasonal components. The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) is an extension of the SARIMA model that also includes the modeling of exogenous variables. Exogenous variables are also called covariates and can be thought of as parallel input sequences that have observations at the same time steps as the original series. The primary series may be referred to as endogenous data to contrast it from the exogenous sequence(s). The observations for exogenous variables are included in the model directly at each time step and are not modeled in the same way as the primary endogenous sequence (e.g. as an AR, MA, etc. process). The SARIMAX method can also be used to model the subsumed models with exogenous variables, such as ARX, MAX, ARMAX, and ARIMAX. The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and/or seasonal components and exogenous variables. The Vector Autoregression (VAR) method models the next step in each time series using an AR model. It is the generalization of AR to multiple parallel time series, e.g. multivariate time series. The notation for the model involves specifying the order for the AR(p) model as parameters to a VAR function, e.g. VAR(p). The method is suitable for multivariate time series without trend and seasonal components. The Vector Autoregression Moving-Average (VARMA) method models the next step in each time series using an ARMA model. It is the generalization of ARMA to multiple parallel time series, e.g. multivariate time series. The notation for the model involves specifying the order for the AR(p) and MA(q) models as parameters to a VARMA function, e.g. VARMA(p, q). A VARMA model can also be used to develop VAR or VMA models. The method is suitable for multivariate time series without trend and seasonal components. The Vector Autoregression Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (VARMAX) is an extension of the VARMA model that also includes the modeling of exogenous variables. It is a multivariate version of the ARMAX method. Exogenous variables are also called covariates and can be thought of as parallel input sequences that have observations at the same time steps as the original series. The primary series(es) are referred to as endogenous data to contrast it from the exogenous sequence(s). The observations for exogenous variables are included in the model directly at each time step and are not modeled in the same way as the primary endogenous sequence (e.g. as an AR, MA, etc. process). The VARMAX method can also be used to model the subsumed models with exogenous variables, such as VARX and VMAX. The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components and exogenous variables. The Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) method models the next time step as an exponentially weighted linear function of observations at prior time steps. The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components. The Holt Winter¡¯s Exponential Smoothing (HWES) also called the Triple Exponential Smoothing method models the next time step as an exponentially weighted linear function of observations at prior time steps, taking trends and seasonality into account. The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and/or seasonal components. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper.

As you ask for the further topic, just wondering if I can request you for a specific topic I have been struggling to get an output. It¡¯s about Structural Dynamic Factor model ( SDFM) by Barigozzi, M., Conti, A., and Luciani, M. (Do euro area countries respond asymmetrically to the common monetary policy) and Mario Forni Luca Gambetti (The Dynamic Effects of Monetary Policy: A Structural Factor Model Approach). Would it be possible for you to go over and estimate these two models using Python or R? It¡¯s just a request from me and sorry if it doesn¡¯t go with your interest. Thanks for the suggestion. I¡¯ve not heard of that method before. I am working on Time series or Prediction  with neural network and SVR, I want to this in matlab by scratch can you give me the references of this materials
 Thank you in advance Sorry, I don¡¯t have any materials for matlab, it is only really used in universities. Hi Jason! From which editor do you import the python code into the webpage of your article? Or what kind of container it that windowed control used to display the python code? Great question, I explain the software I use for the website here:https://machinelearningmastery.com/faq/single-faq/what-software-do-you-use-to-run-your-website Thanks for all the things to try! I recently stumbled over some tasks where the classic algorithms like linear regression or decision trees outperformed even sophisticated NNs. Especially when boosted or averaged out with each other. Maybe its time to try the same with time series forecasting as I¡¯m not getting good results for some tasks with an LSTM. Always start with simple methods before trying more advanced methods.  The complexity of advanced methods just be justified by additional predictive skill. Hi Jason, Thanks for this nice post! You¡¯ve imported the sin function from math many times but have not used it. I¡¯d like to see more posts about GARCH, ARCH and co-integration models. Best,
Elie Thanks, fixed. I have a post on ARCH (and friends) scheduled. Will you consider writing a follow-up book on advanced time-series models soon? Yes, it is written. I am editing it now. The title will be ¡°Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting¡±. CNNs are amazing at time series, and CNNs + LSTMs together are really great. will the new book cover classical time-series models like VAR, GARCH, ..? The focus is deep learning (MLP, CNN and LSTM) with tutorials on how to get the most from classical methods (Naive, SARIMA, ETS) before jumping into deep learning methods. I hope to have it done by the end of the month. This is great news! Don¡¯t you think that R is better suited than Python for classical time-series models? Perhaps generally, but not if you are building a system for operational use. I think Python is a better fit. Great to hear this news. May I ask if the book also cover the topic of multivariate and multistep? Yes, there are many chapters on multi-step and most chapters work with multivariate data. Sounds amazing that you finally <U+0001F609> are geting the new book out on time-series models <U+2013> when will it be available to buy? Thanks. I hope by the end of the month or soon after. I use Prophet.https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html Also, sometimes FastFourier Transformations gives a good result. Thanks. What are the typical application domain of these algos? Forecasting a time series across domains. Hi Jason!
Firstly I congratulate you for your blog. It is helping me a lot in my final work on my bachelor¡¯s degree in Statistics!
What are the assumptions for make forecasting on time series using Machine Learning algorithms? For example, it must to be stationary? Thanks! Gaussian error, but they work anyway if you violate assumptions. The methods like SARIMA/ETS try to make the series stationary as part of modeling (e.g. differencing). You may want to look at power transforms to make data more Gaussian. Comment  Name (required)  Email (will not be published) (required)  Website Hi, I'm Jason Brownlee, Ph.D.
