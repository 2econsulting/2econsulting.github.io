An extension to ARIMA that supports the direct modeling of the seasonal component of the series is called SARIMA. In this tutorial, you will discover the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or SARIMA, method for time series forecasting with univariate data containing trends and seasonality. After completing this tutorial, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. A Gentle Introduction to SARIMA for Time Series Forecasting in PythonPhoto by Mario Micklisch, some rights reserved. This tutorial is divided into four parts; they are: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or ARIMA, is a forecasting method for univariate time series data. As its name suggests, it supports both an autoregressive and moving average elements. The integrated element refers to differencing allowing the method to support time series data with a trend. A problem with ARIMA is that it does not support seasonal data. That is a time series with a repeating cycle. ARIMA expects data that is either not seasonal or has the seasonal component removed, e.g. seasonally adjusted via methods such as seasonal differencing. For more on ARIMA, see the post: An alternative is to use SARIMA. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, SARIMA or Seasonal ARIMA, is an extension of ARIMA that explicitly supports univariate time series data with a seasonal component. It adds three new hyperparameters to specify the autoregression (AR), differencing (I) and moving average (MA) for the seasonal component of the series, as well as an additional parameter for the period of the seasonality. A seasonal ARIMA model is formed by including additional seasonal terms in the ARIMA [¡¦] The seasonal part of the model consists of terms that are very similar to the non-seasonal components of the model, but they involve backshifts of the seasonal period. <U+2014> Page 242, Forecasting: principles and practice, 2013. Configuring a SARIMA requires selecting hyperparameters for both the trend and seasonal elements of the series. There are three trend elements that require configuration. They are the same as the ARIMA model; specifically: There are four seasonal elements that are not part of ARIMA that must be configured; they are: Together, the notation for an SARIMA model is specified as: Where the specifically chosen hyperparameters for a model are specified; for example: Importantly, the m parameter influences the P, D, and Q parameters. For example, an m of 12 for monthly data suggests a yearly seasonal cycle. A P=1 would make use of the first seasonally offset observation in the model, e.g. t-(m*1) or t-12. A P=2, would use the last two seasonally offset observations t-(m * 1), t-(m * 2). Similarly, a D of 1 would calculate a first order seasonal difference and a Q=1 would use a first order errors in the model (e.g. moving average). A seasonal ARIMA model uses differencing at a lag equal to the number of seasons (s) to remove additive seasonal effects. As with lag 1 differencing to remove a trend, the lag s differencing introduces a moving average term. The seasonal ARIMA model includes autoregressive and moving average terms at lag s. <U+2014> Page 142, Introductory Time Series with R, 2009. The trend elements can be chosen through careful analysis of ACF and PACF plots looking at the correlations of recent time steps (e.g. 1, 2, 3). Similarly, ACF and PACF plots can be analyzed to specify values for the seasonal model by looking at correlation at seasonal lag time steps. For more on interpreting ACF/PACF plots, see the post: Seasonal ARIMA models can potentially have a large number of parameters and combinations of terms. Therefore, it is appropriate to try out a wide range of models when fitting to data and choose a best fitting model using an appropriate criterion ¡¦ <U+2014> Pages 143-144, Introductory Time Series with R, 2009. Alternately, a grid search can be used across the trend and seasonal hyperparameters. For more on grid searching ARIMA parameters, see the post: The SARIMA time series forecasting method is supported in Python via the Statsmodels library. To use SARIMA there are three steps, they are: Let¡¯s look at each step in turn. An instance of the SARIMAX class can be created by providing the training data and a host of model configuration parameters. The implementation is called SARIMAX instead of SARIMA because the ¡°X¡± addition to the method name means that the implementation also supports exogenous variables. These are parallel time series variates that are not modeled directly via AR, I, or MA processes, but are made available as a weighted input to the model. Exogenous variables are optional can be specified via the ¡°exog¡± argument. The trend and seasonal hyperparameters are specified as 3 and 4 element tuples respectively to the ¡°order¡± and ¡°seasonal_order¡± arguments. These elements must be specified. These are the main configuration elements. There are other fine tuning parameters you may want to configure. Learn more in the full API: Once the model is created, it can be fit on the training data. The model is fit by calling the fit() function. Fitting the model returns an instance of the SARIMAXResults class. This object contains the details of the fit, such as the data and coefficients, as well as functions that can be used to make use of the model. Many elements of the fitting process can be configured, and it is worth reading the API to review these options once you are comfortable with the implementation. Once fit, the model can be used to make a forecast. A forecast can be made by calling the forecast() or the predict() functions on the SARIMAXResults object returned from calling fit. The forecast() function takes a single parameter that specifies the number of out of sample time steps to forecast, or assumes a one step forecast if no arguments are provided. The predict() function requires a start and end date or index to be specified. Additionally, if exogenous variables were provided when defining the model, they too must be provided for the forecast period to the predict() function.

In this post, you will discover a cheat sheet for the most popular statistical hypothesis tests for a machine learning project with examples using the Python API. Each statistical test is presented in a consistent way, including: Note, when it comes to assumptions such as the expected distribution of data or sample size, the results of a given test are likely to degrade gracefully rather than become immediately unusable if an assumption is violated. Generally, data samples need to be representative of the domain and large enough to expose their distribution to analysis. In some cases, the data can be corrected to meet the assumptions, such as correcting a nearly normal distribution to be normal by removing outliers, or using a correction to the degrees of freedom in a statistical test when samples have differing variance, to name two examples. Finally, there may be multiple tests for a given concern, e.g. normality. We cannot get crisp answers to questions with statistics; instead, we get probabilistic answers. As such, we can arrive at different answers to the same question by considering the question in different ways. Hence the need for multiple different tests for some questions we may have about data.

"mastery",2018-08-13,"How to Reduce Variance in a Final Machine Learning Model","https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-reduce-model-variance/","A final machine learning model is one trained on all available data and is then used to make predictions on new data. A problem with most final models is that they suffer variance in their predictions. This means that each time you fit a model, you get a slightly different set of parameters that in turn will make slightly different predictions. Sometimes more and sometimes less skillful than what you expected. This can be frustrating, especially when you are looking to deploy a model into an operational environment. In this post, you will discover how to think about model variance in a final model and techniques that you can use to reduce the variance in predictions from a final model. After reading this post, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. How to Reduce Variance in a Final Machine Learning ModelPhoto by Kirt Edblom, some rights reserved. Once you have discovered which model and model hyperparameters result in the best skill on your dataset, you¡¯re ready to prepare a final model. A final model is trained on all available data, e.g. the training and the test sets. It is the model that you will use to make predictions on new data were you do not know the outcome. The final model is the outcome of your applied machine learning project. To learn more about preparing a final model, see the post: The bias-variance trade-off is a conceptual idea in applied machine learning to help understand the sources of error in models. The bias-variance tradeoff is a conceptual tool to think about these sources of error and how they are always kept in balance. More bias in an algorithm means that there is less variance, and the reverse is also true. You can learn more about the bias-variance tradeoff in this post: You can control this balance. Many machine learning algorithms have hyperparameters that directly or indirectly allow you to control the bias-variance tradeoff. For example, the k in k-nearest neighbors is one example. A small k results in predictions with high variance and low bias. A large k results in predictions with a small variance and a large bias. Most final models have a problem: they suffer from variance. Each time a model is trained by an algorithm with high variance, you will get a slightly different result. The slightly different model in turn will make slightly different predictions, for better or worse. This is a problem with training a final model as we are required to use the model to make predictions on real data where we do not know the answer and we want those predictions to as good as possible. We want to the best possible version of the model that we can get. We want the variance to play out in our favor. If we can¡¯t achieve that, at least we want the variance to not fall against us when making predictions. There are two common sources of variance in a final model: The first type we introduced above. The second type impacts those algorithms that harness randomness during learning. Three common examples include: You can measure both types of variance in your specific model using your training data. Often, the combined variance is estimated by running repeated k-fold cross-validation on a training dataset then calculating the variance or standard deviation of the model skill. If we want to reduce the amount of variance in a prediction, we must add bias. Consider the case of a simple statistical estimate of a population parameter, such as estimating the mean from a small random sample of data. A single estimate of the mean will have high variance and low bias. This is intuitive because if we repeated this process 30 times and calculated the standard deviation of the estimated mean values, we would see a large spread. The solutions for reducing the variance are also intuitive. Repeat the estimate on many different small samples of data from the domain and calculate the mean of the estimates, leaning on the central limit theorem. The mean of the estimated means will have a lower variance. We have increased the bias by assuming that the average of the estimates will be a more accurate estimate than a single estimate. Another approach would be to dramatically increase the size of the data sample on which we estimate the population mean, leaning on the law of large numbers. The principles used to reduce the variance for a population statistic can also be used to reduce the variance of a final model. We must add bias. Depending on the specific form of the final model (e.g. tree, weights, etc.) you can get creative with this idea. Below are three approaches that you may want to try. If possible, I recommend designing a test harness to experiment and discover an approach that works best or makes the most sense for your specific data set and machine learning algorithm. Instead of fitting a single final model, you can fit multiple final models. Together, the group of final models may be used as an ensemble. For a given input, each model in the ensemble makes a prediction and the final output prediction is taken as the average of the predictions of the models. A sensitivity analysis can be used to measure the impact of ensemble size on prediction variance. As above, multiple final models can be created instead of a single final model. Instead of calculating the mean of the predictions from the final models, a single final model can be constructed as an ensemble of the parameters of the group of final models. This would only make sense in cases where each model has the same number of parameters, such as neural network weights or regression coefficients. For example, consider a linear regression model with three coefficients [b0, b1, b2]. We could fit a group of linear regression models and calculate a final b0 as the average of b0 parameters in each model, and repeat this process for b1 and b2. Again, a sensitivity analysis can be used to measure the impact of ensemble size on prediction variance. Leaning on the law of large numbers, perhaps the simplest approach to reduce the model variance is to fit the model on more training data. In those cases where more data is not readily available, perhaps data augmentation methods can be used instead. A sensitivity analysis of training dataset size to prediction variance is recommended to find the point of diminishing returns. There are approaches to preparing a final model that aim to get the variance in the final model to work for you rather than against you. The commonality in these approaches is that they seek a single best final model. Two examples include: I would argue that these approaches and others like them are fragile. Perhaps you can gamble and aim for the variance to play-out in your favor. This might be a good approach for machine learning competitions where there is no real downside to losing the gamble. I won¡¯t. I think it¡¯s safer to limit the aim for the best average performance and limit the downside. I think that the trick with navigating the bias-variance tradeoff for a final model is to think in samples, not in terms of single models. To optimize for average model performance. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered how to think about model variance in a final model and techniques that you can use to reduce the variance in predictions from a final model. Specifically, you learned: Do you have any questions?
Ask your questions in the comments below and I will do my best to answer. Hi Jason, In the paragraph: Why not use early stopping? You could check the skill of the model against a holdout set during training and stop training when the skill of the model on the hold set starts to degrade. Do you mean:
¡®¡¦ against a validation set ¡¦when the skill of the model on the validation set starts to degrade.¡¯ ? To the best of my knowledge, the hold out set should be kept untouched for final evaluation. Best,
Elie Yes, one and the same. Love these Lessons and examples.
Wish I could find an ¡°Instructor led Course¡± in the USA (?) I¡¯m sure there are thousands of such courses. Do Bayesian ML models have less variance ? Than what? Than the regular ML models which use point estimates for parameters (weights). A great article again. Thank you so much. Would you like to give us an easy example to explain your whole ideas explicitly? Because we need to make several decisions during training the final model and making predictions in the real world. I want to learn how you make decisions when you do a real project. I strongly agree with your opinion on ¡°a final model is to think in samples, not in terms of single models¡± A single best model is too risky for the real problems. It really depends on the problem. I try to provide frameworks to help you make these decisions on your specific dataset. I read your blog for the first time and I guess I became a fan of you.
In the section ¡°Ensemble Parameters from Final Models¡± when using neural networks, how can I use this approach. Do I need to train multiple neural networks having same size and average their weight values?
Will it improve the performance in terms of generalization? Thanks in advance. Correct. It will improve the stability of the forecast via an increase to the bias. It may or may not positively impact generalization <U+2013> my feeling is that it is orthogonal. Is ¡°I think it¡¯s safer to limit the aim for the best average performance and limit the downside.¡± meant to say  ¡°I think it¡¯s safer to aim for the best average performance and limit the downside.¡± Comment  Name (required)  Email (will not be published) (required)  Website Hi, I'm Jason Brownlee, Ph.D.
