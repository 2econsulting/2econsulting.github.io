Too little training will mean that the model will underfit the train and the test sets. Too much training will mean that the model will overfit the training dataset and have poor performance on the test set. A compromise is to train on the training dataset but to stop training at the point when performance on a validation dataset starts to degrade. This simple, effective, and widely used approach to training neural networks is called early stopping. In this post, you will discover that stopping the training of a neural network early before it has overfit the training dataset can reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of deep neural networks. After reading this post, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. A Gentle Introduction to Early Stopping for Avoiding Overtraining Neural Network ModelsPhoto by Benson Kua, some rights reserved. This tutorial is divided into five parts; they are: Training neural networks is challenging. When training a large network, there will be a point during training when the model will stop generalizing and start learning the statistical noise in the training dataset. This overfitting of the training dataset will result in an increase in generalization error, making the model less useful at making predictions on new data. The challenge is to train the network long enough that it is capable of learning the mapping from inputs to outputs, but not training the model so long that it overfits the training data. However, all standard neural network architectures such as the fully connected multi-layer perceptron are prone to overfitting [10]: While the network seems to get better and better, i.e., the error on the training set decreases, at some point during training it actually begins to get worse again, i.e., the error on unseen examples increases. <U+2014> Early Stopping <U+2013> But When?, 2002. One approach to solving this problem is to treat the number of training epochs as a hyperparameter and train the model multiple times with different values, then select the number of epochs that result in the best performance on the train or a holdout test dataset. The downside of this approach is that it requires multiple models to be trained and discarded. This can be computationally inefficient and time-consuming, especially for large models trained on large datasets over days or weeks. An alternative approach is to train the model once for a large number of training epochs. During training, the model is evaluated on a holdout validation dataset after each epoch. If the performance of the model on the validation dataset starts to degrade (e.g. loss begins to increase or accuracy begins to decrease), then the training process is stopped. ¡¦ the error measured with respect to independent data, generally called a validation set, often shows a decrease at first, followed by an increase as the network starts to over-fit. Training can therefore be stopped at the point of smallest error with respect to the validation data set <U+2014> Page 259, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, 2006. The model at the time that training is stopped is then used and is known to have good generalization performance. This procedure is called ¡°early stopping¡± and is perhaps one of the oldest and most widely used forms of neural network regularization. This strategy is known as early stopping. It is probably the most commonly used form of regularization in deep learning. Its popularity is due both to its effectiveness and its simplicity. <U+2014> Page 247, Deep Learning, 2016. If regularization methods like weight decay that update the loss function to encourage less complex models are considered ¡°explicit¡± regularization, then early stopping may be thought of as a type of ¡°implicit¡± regularization, much like using a smaller network that has less capacity. Regularization may also be implicit as is the case with early stopping. <U+2014> Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization, 2017. Early stopping requires that you configure your network to be under constrained, meaning that it has more capacity than is required for the problem. When training the network, a larger number of training epochs is used than may normally be required, to give the network plenty of opportunity to fit, then begin to overfit the training dataset. There are three elements to using early stopping; they are: The performance of the model must be monitored during training. This requires the choice of a dataset that is used to evaluate the model and a metric used to evaluate the model. It is common to split the training dataset and use a subset, such as 30%, as a validation dataset used to monitor performance of the model during training. This validation set is not used to train the model. It is also common to use the loss on a validation dataset as the metric to monitor, although you may also use prediction error in the case of regression, or accuracy in the case of classification. The loss of the model on the training dataset will also be available as part of the training procedure, and additional metrics may also be calculated and monitored on the training dataset. Performance of the model is evaluated on the validation set at the end of each epoch, which adds an additional computational cost during training. This can be reduced by evaluating the model less frequently, such as every 2, 5, or 10 training epochs. Once a scheme for evaluating the model is selected, a trigger for stopping the training process must be chosen. The trigger will use a monitored performance metric to decide when to stop training. This is often the performance of the model on the holdout dataset, such as the loss. In the simplest case, training is stopped as soon as the performance on the validation dataset decreases as compared to the performance on the validation dataset at the prior training epoch (e.g. an increase in loss). More elaborate triggers may be required in practice. This is because the training of a neural network is stochastic and can be noisy. Plotted on a graph, the performance of a model on a validation dataset may go up and down many times. This means that the first sign of overfitting may not be a good place to stop training. ¡¦ the validation error can still go further down after it has begun to increase [¡¦] Real validation error curves almost always have more than one local minimum. <U+2014> Early Stopping <U+2013> But When?, 2002. Some more elaborate triggers may include: Some delay or ¡°patience¡± in stopping is almost always a good idea. ¡¦ results indicate that ¡°slower¡± criteria, which stop later than others, on the average lead to improved generalization compared to ¡°faster¡± ones. However, the training time that has to be expended for such improvements is rather large on average and also varies dramatically when slow criteria are used. <U+2014> Early Stopping <U+2013> But When?, 2002. At the time that training is halted, the model is known to have slightly worse generalization error than a model at a prior epoch. As such, some consideration may need to be given as to exactly which model is saved. Specifically, the training epoch from which weights in the model that are saved to file. This will depend on the trigger chosen to stop the training process. For example, if the trigger is a simple decrease in performance from one epoch to the next, then the weights for the model at the prior epoch will be preferred. If the trigger is required to observe a decrease in performance over a fixed number of epochs, then the model at the beginning of the trigger period will be preferred. Perhaps a simple approach is to always save the model weights if the performance of the model on a holdout dataset is better than at the previous epoch. That way, you will always have the model with the best performance on the holdout set. Every time the error on the validation set improves, we store a copy of the model parameters. When the training algorithm terminates, we return these parameters, rather than the latest parameters. <U+2014> Page 246, Deep Learning, 2016. This section summarizes some examples where early stopping has been used. Yoon Kim in his seminal application of convolutional neural networks to sentiment analysis in the 2014 paper titled ¡°Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification¡± used early stopping with 10% of the training dataset used as the validation hold outset. We do not otherwise perform any dataset-specific tuning other than early stopping on dev sets. For datasets without a standard dev set we randomly select 10% of the training data as the dev set. Chiyuan Zhang, et al. from MIT, Berkeley, and Google in their 2017 paper titled ¡°Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization¡± highlight that on very deep convolutional neural networks for photo classification where there is an abundant dataset that early stopping may not always offer benefit, as the model is less likely to overfit such large datasets. [regarding] the training and testing accuracy on ImageNet [results suggest] a reference of potential performance gain for early stopping. However, on the CIFAR10 dataset, we do not observe any potential benefit of early stopping. Yarin Gal and Zoubin Ghahramani from Cambridge in their 2015 paper titled ¡°A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks¡± use early stopping as an ¡°unregularized baseline¡± for LSTM models on a suite of language modeling problems. Lack of regularisation in RNN models makes it difficult to handle small data, and to avoid overfitting researchers often use early stopping, or small and under-specified models Alex Graves, et al., in their famous 2013 paper titled ¡°Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks¡± achieved state-of-the-art results with LSTMs for speech recognition, while making use of early stopping. Regularisation is vital for good performance with RNNs, as their flexibility makes them prone to overfitting. Two regularisers were used in this paper: early stopping and weight noise ¡¦ This section provides some tips for using early stopping regularization with your neural network. Early stopping is so easy to use, e.g. with the simplest trigger, that there is little reason to not use it when training neural networks. Use of early stopping may be a staple of the modern training of deep neural networks. Early stopping should be used almost universally. <U+2014> Page 425, Deep Learning, 2016. Before using early stopping, it may be interesting to fit an under constrained model and monitor the performance of the model on a train and validation dataset. Plotting the performance of the model in real-time or at the end of a long run will show how noisy the training process is with your specific model and dataset. This may help in the choice of a trigger for early stopping. Loss is an easy metric to monitor during training and to trigger early stopping. The problem is that loss does not always capture what is most important about the model to you and your project. It may be better to choose a performance metric to monitor that best defines the performance of the model in terms of the way you intend to use it. This may be the metric that you intend to use to report the performance of the model. A problem with early stopping is that the model does not make use of all available training data. It may be desirable to avoid overfitting and to train on all possible data, especially on problems where the amount of training data is very limited. A recommended approach would be to treat the number of training epochs as a hyperparameter and to grid search a range of different values, perhaps using k-fold cross-validation. This will allow you to fix the number of training epochs and fit a final model on all available data. Early stopping could be used instead. The early stopping procedure could be repeated a number of times. The epoch number at which training was stopped could be recorded. Then, the average of the epoch number across all repeats of early stopping could be used when fitting a final model on all available training data. This process could be performed using a different split of the training set into train and validation steps each time early stopping is run. An alternative might be to use early stopping with a validation dataset, then update the final model with further training on the held out validation set. Early stopping could be used with k-fold cross-validation, although it is not recommended. The k-fold cross-validation procedure is designed to estimate the generalization error of a model by repeatedly refitting and evaluating it on different subsets of a dataset. Early stopping is designed to monitor the generalization error of one model and stop training when generalization error begins to degrade. They are at odds because cross-validation assumes you don¡¯t know the generalization error and early stopping is trying to give you the best model based on knowledge of generalization error. It may be desirable to use cross-validation to estimate the performance of models with different hyperparameter values, such as learning rate or network structure, whilst also using early stopping. In this case, if you have the resources to repeatedly evaluate the performance of the model, then perhaps the number of training epochs may also be treated as a hyperparameter to be optimized, instead of using early stopping. Instead of using cross-validation with early stopping, early stopping may be used directly without repeated evaluation when evaluating different hyperparameter values for the model (e.g. different learning rates). One possible point of confusion is that early stopping is sometimes referred to as ¡°cross-validated training.¡± Further, research into early stopping that compares triggers may use cross-validation to compare the impact of different triggers. Repeating the early stopping procedure many times may result in the model overfitting the validation dataset. This can happen just as easily as overfitting the training dataset. One approach is to only use early stopping once all other hyperparameters of the model have been chosen. Another strategy may be to use a different split of the training dataset into train and validation sets each time early stopping is used. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered that stopping the training of neural network early before it has overfit the training dataset can reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of deep neural networks. Specifically, you learned: Do you have any questions?

"mastery",2018-12-05,"How to Reduce Overfitting With Dropout Regularization in Keras","https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-reduce-overfitting-with-dropout-regularization-in-keras/","Dropout regularization is a computationally cheap way to regularize a deep neural network. Dropout works by probabilistically removing, or ¡°dropping out,¡± inputs to a layer, which may be input variables in the data sample or activations from a previous layer. It has the effect of simulating a large number of networks with very different network structure and, in turn, making nodes in the network generally more robust to the inputs. In this tutorial, you will discover the Keras API for adding dropout regularization to deep learning neural network models. After completing this tutorial, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. How to Reduce Overfitting With Dropout Regularization in KerasPhoto by PROJorge Lascar, some rights reserved. This tutorial is divided into three parts; they are: Keras supports dropout regularization. The simplest form of dropout in Keras is provided by a Dropout core layer. When created, the dropout rate can be specified to the layer as the probability of setting each input to the layer to zero. This is different from the definition of dropout rate from the papers, in which the rate refers to the probability of retaining an input. Therefore, when a dropout rate of 0.8 is suggested in a paper (retain 80%), this will, in fact, will be a dropout rate of 0.2 (set 20% of inputs to zero). Below is an example of creating a dropout layer with a 50% chance of setting inputs to zero. The Dropout layer is added to a model between existing layers and applies to outputs of the prior layer that are fed to the subsequent layer. For example, given two dense layers: We can insert a dropout layer between them, in which case the outputs or activations of the first layer have dropout applied to them, which are then taken as input to the next layer. It is this second layer now which has dropout applied. Dropout can also be applied to the visible layer, e.g. the inputs to the network. This requires that you define the network with the Dropout layer as the first layer and add the input_shape argument to the layer to specify the expected shape of the input samples. Let¡¯s take a look at how dropout regularization can be used with some common network types. The example below adds dropout between two dense fully connected layers. Dropout can be used after convolutional layers (e.g. Conv2D) and after pooling layers (e.g. MaxPooling2D). Often, dropout is only used after the pooling layers, but this is just a rough heuristic. In this case, dropout is applied to each element or cell within the feature maps. An alternative way to use dropout with convolutional neural networks is to dropout entire feature maps from the convolutional layer which are then not used during pooling. This is called spatial dropout (or ¡°SpatialDropout¡°). Instead we formulate a new dropout method which we call SpatialDropout. For a given convolution feature tensor [¡¦] [we] extend the dropout value across the entire feature map. <U+2014> Efficient Object Localization Using Convolutional Networks, 2015. Spatial Dropout is provided in Keras via the SpatialDropout2D layer (as well as 1D and 3D versions). The example below adds dropout between two layers: an LSTM recurrent layer and a dense fully connected layers. This example applies dropout to, in this case, 32 outputs from the LSTM layer provided as input to the Dense layer. Alternately, the inputs to the LSTM may be subjected to dropout. In this case, a different dropout mask is applied to each time step within each sample presented to the LSTM. There is an alternative way to use dropout with recurrent layers like the LSTM. The same dropout mask may be used by the LSTM for all inputs within a sample. The same approach may be used for recurrent input connections across the time steps of the sample. This approach to dropout with recurrent models is called a Variational RNN. The proposed technique (Variational RNN [¡¦]) uses the same dropout mask at each time step, including the recurrent layers. [¡¦] Implementing our approximate inference is identical to implementing dropout in RNNs with the same network units dropped at each time step, randomly dropping inputs, outputs, and recurrent connections. This is in contrast to existing techniques, where different network units would be dropped at different time steps, and no dropout would be applied to the recurrent connections <U+2014> A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks, 2016. Keras supports Variational RNNs (i.e. consistent dropout across the time steps of a sample for inputs and recurrent inputs) via two arguments on the recurrent layers, namely ¡°dropout¡± for inputs and ¡°recurrent_dropout¡± for recurrent inputs. In this section, we will demonstrate how to use dropout regularization to reduce overfitting of an MLP on a simple binary classification problem. This example provides a template for applying dropout regularization to your own neural network for classification and regression problems. We will use a standard binary classification problem that defines two two-dimensional concentric circles of observations, one circle for each class. Each observation has two input variables with the same scale and a class output value of either 0 or 1. This dataset is called the ¡°circles¡± dataset because of the shape of the observations in each class when plotted. We can use the make_circles() function to generate observations from this problem. We will add noise to the data and seed the random number generator so that the same samples are generated each time the code is run. We can plot the dataset where the two variables are taken as x and y coordinates on a graph and the class value is taken as the color of the observation. The complete example of generating the dataset and plotting it is listed below. Running the example creates a scatter plot showing the concentric circles shape of the observations in each class. We can see the noise in the dispersal of the points making the circles less obvious. Scatter Plot of Circles Dataset with Color Showing the Class Value of Each Sample This is a good test problem because the classes cannot be separated by a line, e.g. are not linearly separable, requiring a nonlinear method such as a neural network to address. We have only generated 100 samples, which is small for a neural network, providing the opportunity to overfit the training dataset and have higher error on the test dataset: a good case for using regularization. Further, the samples have noise, giving the model an opportunity to learn aspects of the samples that don¡¯t generalize. We can develop an MLP model to address this binary classification problem. The model will have one hidden layer with more nodes than may be required to solve this problem, providing an opportunity to overfit. We will also train the model for longer than is required to ensure the model overfits. Before we define the model, we will split the dataset into train and test sets, using 30 examples to train the model and 70 to evaluate the fit model¡¯s performance. Next, we can define the model. The hidden layer uses 500 nodes in the hidden layer and the rectified linear activation function. A sigmoid activation function is used in the output layer in order to predict class values of 0 or 1. The model is optimized using the binary cross entropy loss function, suitable for binary classification problems and the efficient Adam version of gradient descent. The defined model is then fit on the training data for 4,000 epochs and the default batch size of 32. We will also use the test dataset as a validation dataset. We can evaluate the performance of the model on the test dataset and report the result. Finally, we will plot the performance of the model on both the train and test set each epoch. If the model does indeed overfit the training dataset, we would expect the line plot of accuracy on the training set to continue to increase and the test set to rise and then fall again as the model learns statistical noise in the training dataset. We can tie all of these pieces together; the complete example is listed below. Running the example reports the model performance on the train and test datasets. We can see that the model has better performance on the training dataset than the test dataset, one possible sign of overfitting. Your specific results may vary given the stochastic nature of the neural network and the training algorithm. Because the model is severely overfit, we generally would not expect much, if any, variance in the accuracy across repeated runs of the model on the same dataset. A figure is created showing line plots of the model accuracy on the train and test sets. We can see that expected shape of an overfit model where test accuracy increases to a point and then begins to decrease again. Line Plots of Accuracy on Train and Test Datasets While Training Showing an Overfit We can update the example to use dropout regularization. We can do this by simply inserting a new Dropout layer between the hidden layer and the output layer. In this case, we will specify a dropout rate (probability of setting outputs from the hidden layer to zero) to 40% or 0.4. The complete updated example with the addition of dropout after the hidden layer is listed below: Running the example reports the model performance on the train and test datasets. Your results will likely vary. In this case, the resulting model has a high variance. In this specific case, we can see that dropout resulted in a slight drop in accuracy on the training dataset, down from 100% to 96%, and a lift in accuracy on the test set, up from 75% to 81%. Reviewing the line plot of train and test accuracy during training, we can see that it no longer appears that the model has overfit the training dataset. Model accuracy on both the train and test sets continues to increase to a plateau, albeit with a lot of noise given the use of dropout during training. Line Plots of Accuracy on Train and Test Datasets While Training With Dropout Regularization This section lists some ideas for extending the tutorial that you may wish to explore. If you explore any of these extensions, I¡¯d love to know. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper.

"mastery",2018-12-03,"A Gentle Introduction to Dropout for Regularizing Deep Neural Networks","https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-for-regularizing-deep-neural-networks/","Deep learning neural networks are likely to quickly overfit a training dataset with few examples. Ensembles of neural networks with different model configurations are known to reduce overfitting, but require the additional computational expense of training and maintaining multiple models. A single model can be used to simulate having a large number of different network architectures by randomly dropping out nodes during training. This is called dropout and offers a very computationally cheap and remarkably effective regularization method to reduce overfitting and generalization error in deep neural networks of all kinds. In this post, you will discover the use of dropout regularization for reducing overfitting and improving the generalization of deep neural networks. After reading this post, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. A Gentle Introduction to Dropout for Regularizing Deep Neural NetworksPhoto by Jocelyn Kinghorn, some rights reserved. This tutorial is divided into five parts; they are: Large neural nets trained on relatively small datasets can overfit the training data. This has the effect of the model learning the statistical noise in the training data, which results in poor performance when the model is evaluated on new data, e.g. a test dataset. Generalization error increases due to overfitting. One approach to reduce overfitting is to fit all possible different neural networks on the same dataset and to average the predictions from each model. This is not feasible in practice, and can be approximated using a small collection of different models, called an ensemble. With unlimited computation, the best way to ¡°regularize¡± a fixed-sized model is to average the predictions of all possible settings of the parameters, weighting each setting by its posterior probability given the training data. <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. A problem even with the ensemble approximation is that it requires multiple models to be fit and stored, which can be a challenge if the models are large, requiring days or weeks to train and tune. Dropout is a regularization method that approximates training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel. During training, some number of layer outputs are randomly ignored or ¡°dropped out.¡± This has the effect of making the layer look-like and be treated-like a layer with a different number of nodes and connectivity to the prior layer. In effect, each update to a layer during training is performed with a different ¡°view¡± of the configured layer. By dropping a unit out, we mean temporarily removing it from the network, along with all its incoming and outgoing connections <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. Dropout has the effect of making the training process noisy, forcing nodes within a layer to probabilistically take on more or less responsibility for the inputs. This conceptualization suggests that perhaps dropout breaks-up situations where network layers co-adapt to correct mistakes from prior layers, in turn making the model more robust. ¡¦ units may change in a way that they fix up the mistakes of the other units. This may lead to complex co-adaptations. This in turn leads to overfitting because these co-adaptations do not generalize to unseen data. [¡¦] <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. Dropout simulates a sparse activation from a given layer, which interestingly, in turn, encourages the network to actually learn a sparse representation as a side-effect. As such, it may be used as an alternative to activity regularization for encouraging sparse representations in autoencoder models. We found that as a side-effect of doing dropout, the activations of the hidden units become sparse, even when no sparsity inducing regularizers are present. <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. Because the outputs of a layer under dropout are randomly subsampled, it has the effect of reducing the capacity or thinning the network during training. As such, a wider network, e.g. more nodes, may be required when using dropout. Dropout is implemented per-layer in a neural network. It can be used with most types of layers, such as dense fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and recurrent layers such as the long short-term memory network layer. Dropout may be implemented on any or all hidden layers in the network as well as the visible or input layer. It is not used on the output layer. The term ¡°dropout¡± refers to dropping out units (hidden and visible) in a neural network. <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. A new hyperparameter is introduced that specifies the probability at which outputs of the layer are dropped out, or inversely, the probability at which outputs of the layer are retained. The interpretation is an implementation detail that can differ from paper to code library. A common value is a probability of 0.5 for retaining the output of each node in a hidden layer and a value close to 1.0, such as 0.8, for retaining inputs from the visible layer. In the simplest case, each unit is retained with a fixed probability p independent of other units, where p can be chosen using a validation set or can simply be set at 0.5, which seems to be close to optimal for a wide range of networks and tasks. For the input units, however, the optimal probability of retention is usually closer to 1 than to 0.5. <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. Dropout is not used after training when making a prediction with the fit network. The weights of the network will be larger than normal because of dropout. Therefore, before finalizing the network, the weights are first scaled by the chosen dropout rate. The network can then be used as per normal to make predictions. If a unit is retained with probability p during training, the outgoing weights of that unit are multiplied by p at test time <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. The rescaling of the weights can be performed at training time instead, after each weight update at the end of the mini-batch. This is sometimes called ¡°inverse dropout¡± and does not require any modification of weights during training. Both the Keras and PyTorch deep learning libraries implement dropout in this way. At test time, we scale down the output by the dropout rate. [¡¦] Note that this process can be implemented by doing both operations at training time and leaving the output unchanged at test time, which is often the way it¡¯s implemented in practice <U+2014> Page 109, Deep Learning With Python, 2017. Dropout works well in practice, perhaps replacing the need for weight regularization (e.g. weight decay) and activation regularization (e.g. representation sparsity). ¡¦ dropout is more effective than other standard computationally inexpensive regularizers, such as weight decay, filter norm constraints and sparse activity regularization. Dropout may also be combined with other forms of regularization to yield a further improvement. <U+2014> Page 265, Deep Learning, 2016. This section summarizes some examples where dropout was used in recent research papers to provide a suggestion for how and where it may be used. Geoffrey Hinton, et al. in their 2012 paper that first introduced dropout titled ¡°Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors¡± applied used the method with a range of different neural networks on different problem types achieving improved results, including handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), photo classification (CIFAR-10), and speech recognition (TIMIT). ¡¦ we use the same dropout rates <U+2013> 50% dropout for all hidden units and 20% dropout for visible units Nitish Srivastava, et al. in their 2014 journal paper introducing dropout titled ¡°Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting¡± used dropout on a wide range of computer vision, speech recognition, and text classification tasks and found that it consistently improved performance on each problem. We trained dropout neural networks for classification problems on data sets in different domains. We found that dropout improved generalization performance on all data sets compared to neural networks that did not use dropout. On the computer vision problems, different dropout rates were used down through the layers of the network in conjunction with a max-norm weight constraint. Dropout was applied to all the layers of the network with the probability of retaining the unit being p = (0.9, 0.75, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) for the different layers of the network (going from input to convolutional layers to fully connected layers). In addition, the max-norm constraint with c = 4 was used for all the weights. [¡¦] A simpler configuration was used for the text classification task. We used probability of retention p = 0.8 in the input layers and 0.5 in the hidden layers. Max-norm constraint with c = 4 was used in all the layers. Alex Krizhevsky, et al. in their famous 2012 paper titled ¡°ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks¡± achieved (at the time) state-of-the-art results for photo classification on the ImageNet dataset with deep convolutional neural networks and dropout regularization. We use dropout in the first two fully-connected layers [of the model]. Without dropout, our network exhibits substantial overfitting. Dropout roughly doubles the number of iterations required to converge. George Dahl, et al. in their 2013 paper titled ¡°Improving deep neural networks for LVCSR using rectified linear units and dropout¡± used a deep neural network with rectified linear activation functions and dropout to achieve (at the time) state-of-the-art results on a standard speech recognition task. They used a bayesian optimization procedure to configure the choice of activation function and the amount of dropout. ¡¦ the Bayesian optimization procedure learned that dropout wasn¡¯t helpful for sigmoid nets of the sizes we trained. In general, ReLUs and dropout seem to work quite well together. This section provides some tips for using dropout regularization with your neural network. Dropout regularization is a generic approach. It can be used with most, perhaps all, types of neural network models, not least the most common network types of Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks. In the case of LSTMs, it may be desirable to use different dropout rates for the input and recurrent connections. The default interpretation of the dropout hyperparameter is the probability of training a given node in a layer, where 1.0 means no dropout, and 0.0 means no outputs from the layer. A good value for dropout in a hidden layer is between 0.5 and 0.8. Input layers use a larger dropout rate, such as of 0.8. It is common for larger networks (more layers or more nodes) to more easily overfit the training data. When using dropout regularization, it is possible to use larger networks with less risk of overfitting. In fact, a large network (more nodes per layer) may be required as dropout will probabilistically reduce the capacity of the network. A good rule of thumb is to divide the number of nodes in the layer before dropout by the proposed dropout rate and use that as the number of nodes in the new network that uses dropout. For example, a network with 100 nodes and a proposed dropout rate of 0.5 will require 200 nodes (100 / 0.5) when using dropout. If n is the number of hidden units in any layer and p is the probability of retaining a unit [¡¦] a good dropout net should have at least n/p units <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. Rather than guess at a suitable dropout rate for your network, test different rates systematically. For example, test values between 1.0 and 0.1 in increments of 0.1. This will both help you discover what works best for your specific model and dataset, as well as how sensitive the model is to the dropout rate. A more sensitive model may be unstable and could benefit from an increase in size. Network weights will increase in size in response to the probabilistic removal of layer activations. Large weight size can be a sign of an unstable network. To counter this effect a weight constraint can be imposed to force the norm (magnitude) of all weights in a layer to be below a specified value. For example, the maximum norm constraint is recommended with a value between 3-4. [¡¦] we can use max-norm regularization. This constrains the norm of the vector of incoming weights at each hidden unit to be bound by a constant c. Typical values of c range from 3 to 4. <U+2014> Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, 2014. This does introduce an additional hyperparameter that may require tuning for the model. Like other regularization methods, dropout is more effective on those problems where there is a limited amount of training data and the model is likely to overfit the training data. Problems where there is a large amount of training data may see less benefit from using dropout. For very large datasets, regularization confers little reduction in generalization error. In these cases, the computational cost of using dropout and larger models may outweigh the benefit of regularization. <U+2014> Page 265, Deep Learning, 2016. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered the use of dropout regularization for reducing overfitting and improving the generalization of deep neural networks. Specifically, you learned: Do you have any questions?
Ask your questions in the comments below and I will do my best to answer. This is off-topic.
Why do you write most blogs on deep learning methods instead of other methods more suitable for time series data? Good question, generally because I get 100:1 more questions and interest in deep learning, and specifically deep learning with python open source libraries. So if you are working on a personal project, will you use deep learning or the method that gives best results? I use the method that gives the best results and the lowest complexity for a project.
