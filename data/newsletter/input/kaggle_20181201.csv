Their efforts were so inspirational that we reached out and asked if they¡¯d like to shape future ¡°Kaggle Days¡± events together. After the success of the first event in Warsaw last year, we¡¯ve decided to officially partner with LogicAI for additional Kaggle Days events and meetups<U+2014>the first of which will be held in January 2019, in Paris! Why Kaggle Days? The Kaggle community has over 2 million of users from all over the world. As a fully remote team ourselves, we know the importance of getting together in person on a regular basis. Events like Kaggle Days can deepen relations among existing Kagglers, and entice more data scientists to engage with us in the future.  What is Kaggle Days?Kaggle days is a two-event event where data science enthusiasts can talk to each other face to face, exchange knowledge, and compete together.In Warsaw last May, over 100 participants from 30 countries took part in presentations and workshops held by 13 Grandmasters and Masters. Participants were divided up into teams to take part in an 11-hour offline competition!Who can come to Kaggle Days?Anyone who loves data science or wants to learn more is welcome to attend Kaggle Days. To learn more about the upcoming Paris event, visit kaggledays.com/registration Call for SpeakersWant to speak at Kaggle Days? We're taking applications from Kaggle Masters and Grandmasters, as well as anyone in the Data Science community with a unique message to share. If this is you, please tell us more <U+00A0>at: hello@kaggledays.com Local MeetupsIn addition to the tentpole two-day events, the Kaggle Days team is also inviting the Data Science community to host smaller, more frequent Kaggle Days Meetups in their hometowns.
