"mastery",2018-07-13,"17725","https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-power-and-power-analysis-in-python/","The statistical power of a hypothesis test is the probability of detecting an effect, if there is a true effect present to detect. Power can be calculated and reported for a completed experiment to comment on the confidence one might have in the conclusions drawn from the results of the study. It can also be used as a tool to estimate the number of observations or sample size required in order to detect an effect in an experiment. In this tutorial, you will discover the importance of the statistical power of a hypothesis test and now to calculate power analyses and power curves as part of experimental design.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course A statistical hypothesis test makes an assumption about the outcome, called the null hypothesis. For example, the null hypothesis for the Pearson¡¯s correlation test is that there is no relationship between two variables. The null hypothesis for the Student¡¯s t test is that there is no difference between the means of two populations. The test is often interpreted using a p-value, which is the probability of observing the result given that the null hypothesis is true, not the reverse, as is often the case with misinterpretations. In interpreting the p-value of a significance test, you must specify a significance level, often referred to as the Greek lower case letter alpha (a). A common value for the significance level is 5% written as 0.05. The p-value is interested in the context of the chosen significance level. A result of a significance test is claimed to be ¡°statistically significant¡± if the p-value is less than the significance level. This means that the null hypothesis (that there is no result) is rejected. Where: We can see that the p-value is just a probability and that in actuality the result may be different. The test could be wrong. Given the p-value, we could make an error in our interpretation. There are two types of errors; they are: In this context, we can think of the significance level as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it were true. That is the probability of making a Type I Error or a false positive. Statistical power, or the power of a hypothesis test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis. That is, the probability of a true positive result. It is only useful when the null hypothesis is rejected. ¡¦ statistical power is the probability that a test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis. Statistical power has relevance only when the null is false. <U+2014> Page 60, The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes: Statistical Power, Meta-Analysis, and the Interpretation of Research Results, 2010. The higher the statistical power for a given experiment, the lower the probability of making a Type II (false negative) error. That is the higher the probability of detecting an effect when there is an effect. In fact, the power is precisely the inverse of the probability of a Type II error. More intuitively, the statistical power can be thought of as the probability of accepting an alternative hypothesis, when the alternative hypothesis is true. When interpreting statistical power, we seek experiential setups that have high statistical power. Experimental results with too low statistical power will lead to invalid conclusions about the meaning of the results. Therefore a minimum level of statistical power must be sought. It is common to design experiments with a statistical power of 80% or better, e.g. 0.80. This means a 20% probability of encountering a Type II area. This different to the 5% likelihood of encountering a Type I error for the standard value for the significance level. Statistical power is one piece in a puzzle that has four related parts; they are: All four variables are related. For example, a larger sample size can make an effect easier to detect, and the statistical power can be increased in a test by increasing the significance level. A power analysis involves estimating one of these four parameters given values for three other parameters. This is a powerful tool in both the design and in the analysis of experiments that we wish to interpret using statistical hypothesis tests. For example, the statistical power can be estimated given an effect size, sample size and significance level. Alternately, the sample size can be estimated given different desired levels of significance. Power analysis answers questions like ¡°how much statistical power does my study have?¡± and ¡°how big a sample size do I need?¡±. <U+2014> Page 56, The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes: Statistical Power, Meta-Analysis, and the Interpretation of Research Results, 2010. Perhaps the most common use of a power analysis is in the estimation of the minimum sample size required for an experiment. Power analyses are normally run before a study is conducted. A prospective or a priori power analysis can be used to estimate any one of the four power parameters but is most often used to estimate required sample sizes. <U+2014> Page 57, The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes: Statistical Power, Meta-Analysis, and the Interpretation of Research Results, 2010. As a practitioner, we can start with sensible defaults for some parameters, such as a significance level of 0.05 and a power level of 0.80. We can then estimate a desirable minimum effect size, specific to the experiment being performed. A power analysis can then be used to estimate the minimum sample size required. In addition, multiple power analyses can be performed to provide a curve of one parameter against another, such as the change in the size of an effect in an experiment given changes to the sample size. More elaborate plots can be created varying three of the parameters. This is a useful tool for experimental design. We can make the idea of statistical power and power analysis concrete with a worked example. In this section, we will look at the Student¡¯s t test, which is a statistical hypothesis test for comparing the means from two samples of Gaussian variables. The assumption, or null hypothesis, of the test is that the sample populations have the same mean, e.g. that there is no difference between the samples or that the samples are drawn from the same underlying population. The test will calculate a p-value that can be interpreted as to whether the samples are the same (fail to reject the null hypothesis), or there is a statistically significant difference between the samples (reject the null hypothesis). A common significance level for interpreting the p-value is 5% or 0.05. The size of the effect of comparing two groups can be quantified with an effect size measure. A common measure for comparing the difference in the mean from two groups is the Cohen¡¯s d measure. It calculates a standard score that describes the difference in terms of the number of standard deviations that the means are different. A large effect size for Cohen¡¯s d is 0.80 or higher, as is commonly accepted when using the measure. We can use the default and assume a minimum statistical power of 80% or 0.8. For a given experiment with these defaults, we may be interested in estimating a suitable sample size. That is, how many observations are required from each sample in order to at least detect an effect of 0.80 with an 80% chance of detecting the effect if it is true (20% of a Type II error) and a 5% chance of detecting an effect if there is no such effect (Type I error). We can solve this using a power analysis. The statsmodels library provides the TTestIndPower class for calculating a power analysis for the Student¡¯s t test with independent samples. Of note is the TTestPower class that can perform the same analysis for the paired Student¡¯s t test. The function solve_power() can be used to calculate one of the four parameters in a power analysis. In our case, we are interested in calculating the sample size. We can use the function by providing the three pieces of information we know (alpha, effect, and power) and setting the size of argument we wish to calculate the answer of (nobs1) to ¡°None¡°. This tells the function what to calculate. A note on sample size: the function has an argument called ratio that is the ratio of the number of samples in one sample to the other. If both samples are expected to have the same number of observations, then the ratio is 1.0. If, for example, the second sample is expected to have half as many observations, then the ratio would be 0.5. The TTestIndPower instance must be created, then we can call the solve_power() with our arguments to estimate the sample size for the experiment. The complete example is listed below. Running the example calculates and prints the estimated number of samples for the experiment as 25. This would be a suggested minimum number of samples required to see an effect of the desired size. We can go one step further and calculate power curves. Power curves are line plots that show how the change in variables, such as effect size and sample size, impact the power of the statistical test. The plot_power() function can be used to create power curves. The dependent variable (x-axis) must be specified by name in the ¡®dep_var¡® argument. Arrays of values can then be specified for the sample size (nobs), effect size (effect_size), and significance (alpha) parameters. One or multiple curves will then be plotted showing the impact on statistical power. For example, we can assume a significance of 0.05 (the default for the function) and explore the change in sample size between 5 and 100 with low, medium, and high effect sizes. The complete example is listed below. Running the example creates the plot showing the impact on statistical power (y-axis) for three different effect sizes (es) as the sample size (x-axis) is increased. We can see that if we are interested in a large effect that a point of diminishing returns in terms of statistical power occurs at around 40-to-50 observations. Power Curves for Student¡¯s t Test Usefully, statsmodels has classes to perform a power analysis with other statistical tests, such as the F-test, Z-test, and the Chi-Squared test.

"mastery",2018-07-11,"17723","https://machinelearningmastery.com/effect-size-measures-in-python/","Statistical hypothesis tests report on the likelihood of the observed results given an assumption, such as no association between variables or no difference between groups. Hypothesis tests do not comment on the size of the effect if the association or difference is statistically significant. This highlights the need for standard ways of calculating and reporting a result. Effect size methods refer to a suite of statistical tools for quantifying an the size of an effect in the results of experiments that can be used to complement the results from statistical hypothesis tests. In this tutorial, you will discover effect size and effect size measures for quantifying the magnitude of a result. After completing this tutorial, you will know: Let¡¯s get started.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course Once practitioners become versed in statistical methods, it is common to become focused on quantifying the likelihood of a result. This is often seen with the calculation and presentation of the results from statistical hypothesis tests in terms of p-value and the significance level. One aspect that is often neglected in the presentation of results is to actually quantify the difference or relationship, called the effect. It can be easy to forget that the intention of an experiment is to quantify an effect. The primary product of a research inquiry is one or more measures of effect size, not P values. <U+2014> Things I have learned (so far), 1990. The statistical test can only comment on the likelihood that there is an effect. It does not comment on the size of the effect. The results of an experiment could be significant, but the effect so small that it has little consequence. It is possible, and unfortunately quite common, for a result to be statistically significant and trivial. It is also possible for a result to be statistically nonsignificant and important. <U+2014> Page 4, The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes: Statistical Power, Meta-Analysis, and the Interpretation of Research Results, 2010. The problem with neglecting the presentation of the effect is that it may be calculated using ad hoc measures or even ignored completely and left to the reader to interpret. This is a big problem as quantifying the size of the effect is essential to interpreting results. An effect size refers to the size or magnitude of an effect or result as it would be expected to occur in a population. The effect size is estimated from samples of data. Effect size methods refers to a collection of statistical tools used to calculate the effect size. Often the field of effect size measures is referred to as simply ¡°effect size¡°, to note the general concern of the field. It is common to organize effect size statistical methods into groups, based on the type of effect that is to be quantified. Two main groups of methods for calculating effect size are: An effect can be the result of a treatment revealed in a comparison between groups (e.g. treated and untreated groups) or it can describe the degree of association between two related variables (e.g. treatment dosage and health). <U+2014> Page 5, The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes: Statistical Power, Meta-Analysis, and the Interpretation of Research Results, 2010. The result of an effect size calculation must be interpreted, and it depends on the specific statistical method used. A measure must be chosen based on the goals of the interpretation. Three types of calculated result include: Thus, effect size can refer to the raw difference between group means, or absolute effect size, as well as standardized measures of effect, which are calculated to transform the effect to an easily understood scale. Absolute effect size is useful when the variables under study have intrinsic meaning (eg, number of hours of sleep). <U+2014> Using Effect Size<U+2014>or Why the P Value Is Not Enough, 2012. It may be a good idea to report an effect size using multiple measures to aide the different types of readers of your findings. Sometimes a result is best reported both in original units, for ease of understanding by readers, and in some standardized measure for ease of inclusion in future meta-analyses. <U+2014> Page 41, Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis, 2011. The effect size does not replace the results of a statistical hypothesis test. Instead, the effect size complements the test. Ideally, the results of both the hypothesis test and the effect size calculation would be presented side-by-side. The calculation of an effect size could be the calculation of a mean of a sample or the absolute difference between two means. It could also be a more elaborate statistical calculation. In this section, we will look at some common effect size calculations for both associations and differences. The examples of methods is not complete; there may be 100s of methods that can be used to calculate an effect size. The association between variables is often referred to as the ¡°r family¡± of effect size methods. This name comes from perhaps the most common method for calculating the effect size called Pearson¡¯s correlation coefficient, also called Pearson¡¯s r. The Pearson¡¯s correlation coefficient measures the degree of linear association between two real-valued variables. It is a unit-free effect size measure, that can be interpreted in a standard way, as follows: The Pearson¡¯s correlation coefficient can be calculated in Python using the pearsonr() SciPy function. The example below demonstrates the calculation of the Pearson¡¯s correlation coefficient to quantify the size of the association between two samples of random Gaussian numbers where one sample has a strong relationship with the second. Running the example calculates and prints the Pearson¡¯s correlation between the two data samples. We can see that the effect shows a strong positive relationship between the samples. Another very popular method for calculating the association effect size is the r-squared measure, or r^2, also called the coefficient of determination. It summarizes the proportion of variance in one variable explained by the other. The difference between groups is often referred to as the ¡°d family¡± of effect size methods. This name comes from perhaps the most common method for calculating the difference between the mean value of groups, called Cohen¡¯s d. Cohen¡¯s d measures the difference between the mean from two Gaussian-distributed variables. It is a standard score that summarizes the difference in terms of the number of standard deviations. Because the score is standardized, there is a table for the interpretation of the result, summarized as: The Cohen¡¯s d calculation is not provided in Python; we can calculate it manually. The calculation of the difference between the mean of two samples is as follows: Where d is the Cohen¡¯s d, u1 is the mean of the first sample, u2 is the mean of the second sample, and s is the pooled standard deviation of both samples. The pooled standard deviation for two independent samples can be calculated as follows: Where s is the pooled standard deviation, n1 and n2 are the size of the first sample and second samples and s1^2 and s2^2 is the variance for the first and second samples. The subtractions are the adjustments for the number of degrees of freedom. The function below will calculate the Cohen¡¯s d measure for two samples of real-valued variables. The NumPy functions mean() and var() are used to calculate the sample mean and variance respectively. The example below calculates the Cohen¡¯s d measure for two samples of random Gaussian variables with differing means. The example is contrived such that the means are different by one half standard deviation and both samples have the same standard deviation. Running the example calculates and prints the Cohen¡¯s d effect size. We can see that as expected, the difference between the means is one half of one standard deviation interpreted as a medium effect size. Two other popular methods for quantifying the difference effect size are: This section lists some ideas for extending the tutorial that you may wish to explore.

"mastery",2018-07-09,"17721","https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-calculate-nonparametric-rank-correlation-in-python/","Correlation is a measure of the association between two variables. It is easy to calculate and interpret when both variables have a well understood Gaussian distribution. When we do not know the distribution of the variables, we must use nonparametric rank correlation methods. In this tutorial, you will discover rank correlation methods for quantifying the association between variables with a non-Gaussian distribution. After completing this tutorial, you will know: Let¡¯s get started. This tutorial is divided into 4 parts; they are: Take my free 7-day email crash course now (with sample code). Click to sign-up and also get a free PDF Ebook version of the course. Download Your FREE Mini-Course Correlation refers to the association between the observed values of two variables. The variables may have a positive association, meaning that as the values for one variable increase, so do the values of the other variable. The association may also be negative, meaning that as the values of one variable increase, the values of the others decrease. Finally, the association may be neutral, meaning that the variables are not associated. Correlation quantifies this association, often as a measure between the values -1 to 1 for perfectly negatively correlated and perfectly positively correlated. The calculated correlation is referred to as the ¡°correlation coefficient.¡± This correlation coefficient can then be interpreted to describe the measures. See the table below to help with interpretation the correlation coefficient. Table of Correlation Coefficient Values and Their InterpretationTaken from ¡°Nonparametric Statistics for Non-Statisticians: A Step-by-Step Approach¡±. The correlation between two variables that each have a Gaussian distribution can be calculated using standard methods such as the Pearson¡¯s correlation. This procedure cannot be used for data that does not have a Gaussian distribution. Instead, rank correlation methods must be used. Rank correlation refers to methods that quantify the association between variables using the ordinal relationship between the values rather than the specific values. Ordinal data is data that has label values and has an order or rank relationship; for example: ¡®low¡®, ¡®medium¡®, and ¡®high¡®. Rank correlation can be calculated for real-valued variables. This is done by first converting the values for each variable into rank data. This is where the values are ordered and assigned an integer rank value. Rank correlation coefficients can then be calculated in order to quantify the association between the two ranked variables. Because no distribution for the values is assumed, rank correlation methods are referred to as distribution-free correlation or nonparametric correlation. Interestingly, rank correlation measures are often used as the basis for other statistical hypothesis tests, such as determining whether two samples were likely drawn from the same (or different) population distributions. Rank correlation methods are often named after the researcher or researchers that developed the method. Four examples of rank correlation methods are as follows: In the following sections, we will take a closer look at two of the more common rank correlation methods: Spearman¡¯s and Kendall¡¯s. Before we demonstrate rank correlation methods, we must first define a test problem. In this section, we will define a simple two-variable dataset where each variable is drawn from a uniform distribution (e.g. non-Gaussian) and the values of the second variable depend on the values of the first value. Specifically, a sample of 1,000 random floating point values are drawn from a uniform distribution and scaled to the range 0 to 20. A second sample of 1,000 random floating point values are drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 10 and added to values in the first sample to create an association. The complete example is listed below. Running the example generates the data sample and graphs the points on a scatter plot. We can clearly see that each variable has a uniform distribution and the positive association between the variables is visible by the diagonal grouping of the points from the bottom left to the top right of the plot. Scatter Plot of Associated Variables Drawn From a Uniform Distribution Spearman¡¯s rank correlation is named for Charles Spearman. It may also be called Spearman¡¯s correlation coefficient and is denoted by the lowercase greek letter rho (p). As such, it may be referred to as Spearman¡¯s rho. This statistical method quantifies the degree to which ranked variables are associated by a monotonic function, meaning an increasing or decreasing relationship. As a statistical hypothesis test, the method assumes that the samples are uncorrelated (fail to reject H0). The Spearman rank-order correlation is a statistical procedure that is designed to measure the relationship between two variables on an ordinal scale of measurement. <U+2014> Page 124, Nonparametric Statistics for Non-Statisticians: A Step-by-Step Approach, 2009. The intuition for the Spearman¡¯s rank correlation is that it calculates a Pearson¡¯s correlation (e.g. a parametric measure of correlation) using the rank values instead of the real values. Where the Pearson¡¯s correlation is the calculation of the covariance (or expected difference of observations from the mean) between the two variables normalized by the variance or spread of both variables. Spearman¡¯s rank correlation can be calculated in Python using the spearmanr() SciPy function. The function takes two real-valued samples as arguments and returns both the correlation coefficient in the range between -1 and 1 and the p-value for interpreting the significance of the coefficient. We can demonstrate the Spearman¡¯s rank correlation on the test dataset. We know that there is a strong association between the variables in the dataset and we would expect the Spearman¡¯s test to find this association. The complete example is listed below. Running the example calculates the Spearman¡¯s correlation coefficient between the two variables in the test dataset. The statistical test reports a strong positive correlation with a value of 0.9. The p-value is close to zero, which means that the likelihood of observing the data given that the samples are uncorrelated is very unlikely (e.g. 95% confidence) and that we can reject the null hypothesis that the samples are uncorrelated. Kendall¡¯s rank correlation is named for Maurice Kendall. It is also called Kendall¡¯s correlation coefficient, and the coefficient is often referred to by the lowercase Greek letter tau (t). In turn, the test may be called Kendall¡¯s tau. The intuition for the test is that it calculates a normalized score for the number of matching or concordant rankings between the two samples. As such, the test is also referred to as Kendall¡¯s concordance test. The Kendall¡¯s rank correlation coefficient can be calculated in Python using the kendalltau() SciPy function. The test takes the two data samples as arguments and returns the correlation coefficient and the p-value. As a statistical hypothesis test, the method assumes (H0) that there is no association between the two samples. We can demonstrate the calculation on the test dataset, where we do expect a significant positive association to be reported. The complete example is listed below. Running the example calculates the Kendall¡¯s correlation coefficient as 0.7, which is highly correlated. The p-value is close to zero (and printed as zero), as with the Spearman¡¯s test, meaning that we can confidently reject the null hypothesis that the samples are uncorrelated.
