"datacamp",2018-07-16,"Data Science at McKinsey (Transcript)","https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/data-science-mckinsey","Here is a link to the podcast. Hugo:    Hi there Taras, and welcome to DataFramed. Taras:    Hi Hugo. I'm really glad to be here. Hugo:    It's great to have you on the show. I'm really excited to be talking about management consulting, analytics for businesses, and data science. So you're a Senior Analytics Manager at McKinsey and I want to know what that looks like on the ground. But before we get there, I'd like to know what your colleagues think that you do. Taras:    My colleagues, especially that don't do analytics themselves, don't always have a very clear view. Most of them think I spent most of my time building models. Some of my analytics colleagues think that I spend most of my time talking to clients but the truth is a lot broader than that. Hugo:    And I'm excited to get to that. I'm wondering, for the non-technical people, your colleagues, what does building models mean to them? What do they think building models looks like? Taras:    It's one of those sometimes scary, sometimes black box type of process where they see it as a whole bunch of random data from different client systems coming in and the outcome comes out that hopefully tells them some insights into what drives performance of the clients or what they should advise clients to do but for most non-technical people, most but not all, this process is not very, very transparent. Hugo:    Yeah, and I suppose they think there's some sort of computation involved; some sort of mathematics involved but they don't have a strong sense of what that may mean. Taras:    Exactly. But there are some people that do a lot of analytic work, even if they are not data scientist themselves, and for them they actually know exactly what's going on, they just don't write the code. It's actually impressive how well they understand the underlying data science. Hugo:    And I think McKinsey does an incredible job in a lot of work in thinking about how to explain technical model building, data science, analytic techniques, to a broader audience. I saw recently there's a great interactive, web-based explanation you have called an Executive's Guide to AI, which really explains the nuts and bolts to what type of models are considered artificial intelligence these days. Taras:    That's exactly right. We actually worked on that: one expert from our team really drove development of most of the content for the guide. We get this question asked all the time and we cannot use technical language to executives because they need to understand it, and the same time we really want to be factually accurate. Things like that, even explaining what machine learning, what deep learning is in simple terms is, is very very important for us. I think it's actually very important more generally, so people can make decisions, actually understand what they're trying to accomplish and they feel comfortable acting on it. Hugo:    Yeah, I like that, and I like the fact that a subtle overtone of what you just said then is that the machines don't necessarily make decisions yet. We do have certain types of learning algorithms, reinforcement learning in particular, but the fact that when we're looking at predictive analytics, we've got AI making predictions but then it's up to human responsibility to then make decisions and take action. Taras:    It's a great point. I think it's one of the key things to understand how different is model prediction from the actual decision. Model prediction might say that a customer is likely to buy certain product if it's offered at a certain discount or a customer is likely to leave the company because of interruptions in services. But that has nothing to do with the business decision that the senior executive needs to make, which usually is what type of discounts to offer to any particular customer, because there's a lot more going on. There's a lot more strategic, as well as operational practices.Taras:    Sometimes people think predicting the outcome, through the model, is the same as acting on it. It's just the beginning. There's a really, really long chain of thinking, usually qualitative thinking, that need to happen before you act on a decision. Not always. In some cases decisions need to be made in real time. For example, banking fraud or credit card fraud, and then algorithms actually act but for management consulting, when you talk about strategy and really high impact decisions, models need to be interpreted. We like to use the word translated, and the implications need to be assessed and pressure-tested before anyone can make any decision because the stakes are just too high. Hugo:    I love it and I look forward to returning to these ideas when we talk about specific verticals and industries where you see the most demand for data science analytics and management consulting. Let's get back to you before we get there. You told us that you colleagues generally will think that you build models to talk to clients but you also told us that what you do is a lot more broad then that. So what do you actually do? Taras:    I spend time in 4 to 5 different areas. As somebody who built and is leading a fairly large data science team, probably the most important part of my work is to make sure that we have the right capabilities that we can serve our clients on what their needs are. That involves quite a lot of strategic thinking in terms of what problems data science will be solving tomorrow or next year, and working backwards from there: what people you need to have on a team, what technologies you need to test out, what use cases and what clients you want to work with. There's a little bit of that.Taras:    A second piece is extremely important for anybody, which is the essential piece around relationship management. For us, that means working with clients, managing strategic relationships so we can actually deploy data science tools and derive real change. Those are internal. As a data science function, you need to work with technology function, with data function, with business development function, with marketing function, with individual businesses because data science is by nature is so embedded into the rest of the organization that you cannot be effective unless you spend significant time, 30-50% of your time just managing the relationships.Taras:    It's still a people world so you need to help people be successful and that starts at just the first interview that you interview somebody and hopefully if they get hired, then it's onboarding, then it's finding the right projects, then it's doing mentorship on the project, handling conflicts, helping people grow in what role they are in - how experienced they are - because consulting is people business and the only way to create impact is by mentoring, developing people, creating opportunities for them.Taras:    And then of course there is the actual data science part which I really, really enjoy doing. For me that's usually involves working with data scientist from the team, helping them structure their approach, and then helping them, if things don't work, to understand why so they are able to build models and deliver the outcomes. I still sometimes try to be hands-on data scientist write code and build models myself but it's really, really hard to find time. Hugo:    I'm sure. Taras:    Last piece, is of course, whenever I serve clients, it's making sure they can digest the models we are building for them. They know what the models mean. They can act on them, they can implement them, they actually most importantly measure the outcomes post implementation. They can see this really works and it's actual, tangible outcomes benefits either financial or other benefits to their organizations because that's the heart of what we do as consultants in data science. Hugo:    So really that last point speaks to something very essential to the job that you do which is taking the results of the data analytic and data science process, and as we said, turning them into decisions and actionables. But even before that I suppose, you need to translate the business problem into a data science question, solve it to a certain extent and then translate it back to an actionable. You have this two bi-directional process, in and out of data science, right? Taras:    That's absolutely right. There is always a process of ... even understanding the business problem, and then translating that into an analytics approach and in the consulting settings, that's actually not that straightforward because at the beginning when we just start the project, we don't always know everything we would like to know about the client business and especially about their data environment and how they make decisions. The process becomes very iterative. Based on what we know, we structure an analytics process, figure out which models need to be built, at what level of granularity, with what data, and then we try that and while we're trying that, we see what works and what doesn't. We show it to clients. We get their input and based on that we refine the  analytics approach until we actually get to something that's as meaningful and impactful as possible. So that translation happens at the beginning but it continues throughout the project. Hugo:    Does the question arise “is data science or data analytics even the appropriate approach to the business question posed?”? Taras:    Absolutely and I think it's the right question to ask. If you can solve the client question with a simpler approach, there is no need for data science or advanced analytics. I think advanced analytics is a great tool but we shouldn't try to force it to be used everywhere and if a simpler approach works or there's not enough data, then some high level strategic qualitative thinking or some interview-based approach or some case study based approach works much better. On the other hand there are real cases where you have to use fairly advanced modeling to get to an understanding of the environment or market or business that's deep enough and that's accurate enough. That's the case for data science.Taras:    And by the way, what was really interesting is that it happens both ways. Sometimes you start an advanced analytics project that you think you build a lot of models, and as you learn client business or data availability more, you realize that's just not going to work, so you go back to basic qualitative analysis. Sometimes you start this strategy project that has none of these components, and in the middle you realize that there's so much to be learned from applying advanced machine learning that you can re-scope the project and bring that in. And that's why it's so important to have people involved in the project who actually understand data science as well as understand the business question; and then they can make these decisions on what's the best approach to go forward. Hugo:    This actually speaks to something else, that different people on your team have different skills, and you mentioned that you need a fairly large team of data scientists, and my question there is, have we as a community figured out what data science teams should look like? And what I mean by that is with backend engineers, we know what those teams generally look like and how they work together and best practices. Have we figured this out in data science yet? Taras:    It's an excellent question. I don't think we have and I believe it's not just McKinsey or consulting. I think it's in general. It's evolving very, very quickly. Our own journey was that in the beginning we had more people who were predictive modelers and who had very broad backgrounds. They could build a wide range of predictive models. Increasingly what I see is that on one hand you need to start specializing much deeper so you need to start having people that only do NLP or only do deep learning or only do anomaly detection.Taras:    On the other hand, analytics is found beyond predictive modeling. For many questions that we need to answer now, somebody understand complexity theory and can do real advanced simulations is actually invaluable. I only see this process of changing the needs for data science skills accelerating with every year. For us, not only have we not figured out the steady state but I don't think there is a steady state.Taras:    On the other hand, analytics is found beyond predictive modeling. For many questions that we need to answer now, somebody understand complexity theory and can do real advanced simulations is actually invaluable. I only see this process of changing the needs for data science skills accelerating with every year. For us, not only have we not figured out the steady state but I don't think there is a steady state. Taras:    Maybe for some organizations that have much more fixed business model that you only need certain types of skills sets, maybe that's more steady, but even then I don't believe, given how quickly data science changes, you can be static about it. You need to constantly be adding skill sets and moving along with the field. Hugo:    And something you've spoken to there, is not only is the skill set changing so rapidly and the techniques, but even what happens on a daily basis. As we see more feature selection automated, more data manipulation, data munging, data cleaning, automated machine learning, for example, we're going to see what data scientists do on the ground evolving incredibly quickly. Taras:    That's absolutely right. I think it's amazing to have tools now that we didn't have two years ago. Even for computing infrastructure, you can go to Google Cloud or AWS and spin the system of clusters with all the software that you need in one click of a button, which was completely impossible before. That changes the speed with which we work and the nature of the models we can build and how easy it is, so much that suddenly it opens up new possibilities. There's only strong influence of technology on what skill sets data scientists need to have as well. Hugo:    Fantastic. I want to jump in now and find out through the lens of your work at McKinsey, which verticals and/or industries do you see the most demand for data science, data analytics, management consulting, at the moment? Taras:    If I look at the moment, I think about it in 3 broad buckets of industries. The first one is the one that really interacts with consumers directly. Industries like retail, industries like telecom, some media, some banking, and for them the need to set up - it's actually really driven by personalization - the need to heavily customize their products, their marketing messages to individual consumers ideally and do it in real time with as much data and analytics as possible is really key. Taras:    The other bucket is essentially organizations for which risk management is a big deal. Insurance for example. Insurance is all about price and risk properly and managing claim processing very efficiently. Setting up the rates very efficiently and for them you can't do risk management without quantitative methods. That is another really, really interesting application of analytics. Taras:    And then finally many other organizations generate a lot of data from their operations. For example, think about a semi-conductive fab that has literally hundreds of different pieces of equipment and each piece of equipment for each process step, making chips, generates real time data with millisecond precision from all the sensors. It's extremely complex. The data is very large and all real time and the stakes are really high to optimize manufacturing and do it well. I think for those organizations there is huge need for advanced analytics to be driving better decisions. Another piece similar is genomics in bioinformatics: huge amount of data coming in. Taras:    Another piece is health care where you have now structured data on health care claims but also unstructured data from medical testing, images, etc. This is a little bit more where data is there but analytic methods are not always there. The data has not been used yet, fully, and that's another area where there is increasing pool for data science. Hugo:    There is so much interesting stuff in there that I'm at a loss to figure out quite which direction to go. You stated industry verticals that address a lot of consumer interactions, those that need excellent risk management. You also mentioned industries where data is being generated. Semi-conductors are really interesting because I think a lot of people, when they think about data science, they think about data science in tech where we kind of know what we're doing a lot of the time. But when we've got real time data flowing straight in and we need to make decisions straight away or automate those decisions, that's a very different game isn't it? Taras:    Absolutely. We always talk about digital born companies and they do amazing stuff don't get me wrong, but if you're a completely digital company, it's actually easy because all your information is digital. You can access it and you can test your ideas really quickly. It's just natural. Try to actually do analytics if you're a semi-conductor player or if you're agriculture provider. Some of my most fascinating experienced were actually in old school field like agriculture but imagine that you have a tractor, driving in a farm. The tractor has a whole bunch of sensors. Now tractor has a video camera that can film the fields and you have a drone that flies on top and it takes real time data of the crop. All of this needs to be transferred, in a very low cost, from the farm to a central processing unit or all the computations have to be on premise, on tractor, as an edge system. Taras:    And you need to optimize an extremely complex set of real, physical equipment actions. It's actually really, really hard and you need to do it in such a way that the farmer would not mind using the advanced analytics to improve his yield of crops. I think very often we don't give enough credit for traditional industries that operate in the physical world because it's so much harder.. To me that is were a lot of value of analytics in the future will be coming from. Hugo:    That agriculture example is so fantastic because it speaks to another very interesting concern that ... lets say that you have a drone taking photograph and you want to do some image analysis, pattern recognition, object detection, bounding boxes, whatever it may be. You might say I can just throw a huge convolutional neural net at it. Having said that, if you want to do this in real time in the drone, sure if you’ve got clusters in the cloud, you can do this, but if you want to do this in real time in the drone, it will actually change what type of model you build to do it, right? Taras:    Exactly because literally in that time, you start thinking about time it takes to classify single image and you actually literally start counting how many milliseconds your convolutional network can run. Different between 100 milliseconds and 300 milliseconds means certain speed of flying for the drone and you just cannot go sometimes with the 300 because otherwise to take image of 100 acre fields will take you forever. You go with simpler models that can work in the ag computing environment that maybe not as accurate as possible or you spend a lot of time thinking through your deploying architecture, how to keep accuracy up but reduce computing time down dramatically. Taras:    That's another fascinating problem that's very different from what conventional data scientists will have to deal with. Hugo:    Right. Now I want to jump in and find out about organizations that you've worked with or industries. I do understand that there are certain ... there's a lot of privacy you need to respect with respect to your client base but I was wondering if you'll tell me about a few key examples of organizations and/or industries that you've worked with. Taras:    Yeah, absolutely. Let me switch gears and talk again about another real low tech line. I work with a correctional facility and the problem that they had was problem of violence. The inmates were sometimes really violent and they were seeing increases in violence and the administration could not understand why. It's very challenging environment. It's always high pressure and the stakes are really high. Literally people might get injured or killed. On the other hand, you have ability to act and a lot of data you can use to make better decisions. Taras:    What we've done is we looked at what actually drives violence in each group. It's not necessarily about individuals. It's about if you put certain number of individual in the same cell, it's the relative composition of people that go in there that increases or decreases the violence. If you start thinking about it from the quantitative perspective and understand what drives that, you can actually reduce violence quite dramatically. Taras:    It's a great example where looking at industry that traditionally does not use analytics leads to a huge impact and it really makes a difference in a major way. Hugo:    So that sounds like a success story. I do think when an organization has challenges or problems where data analytics can help to solve, there is some sort of barrier. The value needs to be created and it needs to be demonstrated. I'm wondering what does it take to change an organization in terms of their decision making process, to change them through data science? Taras:    That's a great question. It's a very challenging task because many things need to happen and all of them need to happen. If one link is missing, chances are it's not going to work. First of all you need to have a vision of what analytics should do for an organization. Why do you actually want to have data science or analytics in the organization and people need to believe it will add value, and it is connected to the business strategy. Not just analytic teams but throughout the organization.Taras:    Secondly, you need to have support from very senior executives, ideally C-level, to actually create that excitement in the organization, to make sure we have the right visibility and funding and right resources to do it; and to actually help analytics or data science team work with other parts of the business. Because with all of that, very often data scientists just build models in isolation and models never get used. Then you need to have the right data and data environment, and that is relatively a slow process that can be expensive. You always need to start building that environment but you shouldn't wait until that is done before you start deploying analytics.Taras:    You want to identify areas where you can drive real measurable results very quickly so that there is excitement in the organization about the analytics and more and more people want to try. That's what we mean by use cases. You find out where there is the biggest value for analytics, and you go, and you build the models. You start making decisions different. You capture that value for 3, 4, 5 use cases quickly and then everybody wants to do it for their own part of business. Taras:    And then you need to make sure it actually sticks; it's not something that you've done once. People use it for three months and then they went back to the old ways. To make something stick, you need to redesign the processes of making decisions that usually involve some kind of technology solution - software or interfaces - to make analytics digestible and it involves retraining people. It involves new ways to measure the outcomes of the decisions. Taras:    And finally, organizations that are really great at analytics, they always do that. You need to change the culture of the organization so that every time you're on a business meeting and you want to propose something, people will ask what data do we have to act on this proposal. Is it really backed up by hard numbers, well-designed models or not? And once you get to that level, then analytics truly becomes part of the company DNA and you accomplish what you're trying to do but that is multi-year journey for most organizations, and it's not easy. Hugo:    Right. I want to zoom in on this idea of early stage value extraction, in particular through several use cases. I suppose this essentially is having a few proofs of concepts, demonstrating their value, and gaining trust of people at different levels throughout the organization. Taras:    Yes. That's fair. Think about it from the perspective of a business executive who doesn't necessarily understand technology. It's a buzz, everybody talks about it but you want to know if this thing is real or not. What real means is if I start doing what the model tells me to do, is my business doing better or worse? You need to convince somebody to give you a shot, which usually happens through the proof of concept, and then you need to very rigorously measure what happened so that it's so clear, that there was impact and the impact is directly attributable to analytics. That use case does two things for you: A, the business partner that you work with becomes a champion for you and uses more analytics within their own part of business; but B, creates a much broader visibility that other people see it and other people say, ""You know what, this thing actually really, really works and I'm just going to go and try to do it.""Taras:    Then finally, what's important is if you can show that you spend $2 million on a use case but it generated $50 million in revenue or in cost savings, suddenly you can claim that analytics becomes self-funded so organizations can allocate a bigger budget to do another 3 or 4 use cases and to fund new technology or new software or new data management systems and that's how you get going in real organizations because you always need to justify the budget that you spent on certain activities. Hugo:    Right. So you mentioned if one of these moving parts is missing, the change in the organization will very likely fail. There's a lot of these moving parts. You mentioned creating the vision for analytics, having strong support particularly at C-level, early value extraction, process redesign, culture change, data foundation. It seems like a lot to get working together. How often are you able to do that? How often are you able to see it all work together? Taras:    It's a great question. Another question to ask, another way to ask this is, how many organizations have actually been able to achieve it? There is not many. In each industry there is maybe 2, 3, 4 organizations that are ahead of the pack and sometimes none of them actually achieve this wide acceptance of analytics in every decision making that we talk about. It's actually tough but what we're seeing is that where clients are now, it's very different from where they were 2 years ago. Everybody is moving in the right direction and most companies are making significant progress. All of them are not there yet and I think this journey will take a little bit longer for them. Taras:    There's too many things that need to happen and each of these steps is quite a long step. Hugo:    So Taras, you've been leveraging data science to help Fortune 500 companies, for example, improve their performance for over a decade now. How have the different moving parts of data science evolved over this time? Taras:    It's fascinating. I would say that there's so many changes that happen in so many ways. The simplest one to see is software. Ten years ago we were using mostly SAS, and then open source became really prominent and people moved to R, and then to Python and there is just continuous emergence of new software tools and that's very easy to see and track. Taras:    Second piece I think is for algorithms themselves. Ten years ago we were still doing a lot of BI, and we were a doing a little bit of statistical modeling, but it was mostly linear models. It was classical statistics but then machine learning became much more prominent, and then every quickly we started being able to work with unstructured data through deep learning, through NLP, and to me that's the next wave that's happening now, moving to the unstructured information. Taras:    Another change that I noticed is in what domains analytics is used. Ten years ago market analytics was big. Risk analytics was big in financial sector because financial sector really needed that. And then some of the heavily operational companies would use supply chains in inventory management, but those are three big areas. Now if you look at where analytics is, it's literally everywhere. It's in HR organization function. It's understanding what people to hire and when they are likely to leave.Taras:    It's every interaction we have with customers, it’s customization. It's just so broad and that's relatively new. This spread of analytics into every decision making is something that happened in the last 10 years and to me that's probably the most fascinating part. Hugo:    I think the HR example is really interesting and we’re seeing increases in machines helping out with the hiring process, for example, of course machines can encode human biases, machines can create their own type of biases as well. I'm wondering what your view on these types of biases that may occur, what the major challenges are, and how important it is to have a human in the loop as much as possible. Taras:    That's another great question. I will tell you my own perspective. I do think there's many different points of views on this. I think that human plus machine works a lot better than just machine alone. Some of my colleagues that are data scientist in tech firms actually disagree and they see their role as getting human out of the loop and fully automating everything. I think there's a difference in the nature of the problems we are trying to solve with analytics. But for me, on the one hand, it's really good to design algorithms with as little bias as possible, and bias usually just comes from your input data. Taras:    You need to think about is your data is actually representative or is it biased in any particular way. But on the other hand, once you get your model predictions, what do you do with it? We still come back to the issue of translation and to act properly on output algorithms, that's where humans really add value. If I go to the HR example, for example, I spend a lot of time looking at McKinsey's recruiting and understanding what performance characteristics people display during interviews and predict their long-term success but it's not like I take output of predictive model and allow algorithm decide who is going to get hired or not.Taras:    It's just for us to inform our recruiting process to focus on the relevant things but humans still need to process, digest, assess how precise the predictions are and assess false positives and true positives and based on that, design the right recruiting process. You can't just take human out and let algorithm design. It will not work very well for much qualitative, strategic decision you need to make. Hugo:    You actually said something very interesting, well a lot of very interesting things in there, but something I want to zoom in on is you said a model may optimize long term success, and we might not even know how to define long-term success correctly. That may be something that evolves over time. Trying to figure out what we're actually optimizing for or what we're learning is just as important as implementing the algorithm. Taras:    Absolutely. The performance metrics matter tremendously and sometimes we see if you change one metric to the other, suddenly the models change a lot. That's also why it's so important to keep an open mind and have a human involved because sometimes we build models for different outcomes. The outcome may be, if I take a slightly more traditional commercial example, outcome might be revenue growth. It might be profitability. It might be market share, and you realize if you build 3 different models with 3 different outcomes, you get 3 different set of drivers and if you start analyzing the differences between them, you really get a much deeper understanding of your market dynamics because you look at multiple dimension of the problem. That's absolutely critical. Hugo:    So you got some really nice insight into how you're seeing the different moving parts of data science evolve over the past decade and more. How do you see the different parts of data science evolving in the future? Taras:    It's fascinating. For one thing, I think open source is here to stay. I just can't imagine doing analytics without open source, given how complex it gets and how increasingly powerful it becomes. We all have to share the code, share algorithms, and it will remain relevant for a very long time.
Taras:    Secondly, I think unstructured data will become more and more important. It's already most information that's been generated has been unstructured, but we are just at the beginning to use it and I think the advances that can come with improving, for example, NLP techniques, will be truly transformative and it's actually beginning very, very real. Even the work we do now in NLP, it's so different now than what you could do 2 years ago, that if i just fast forward the pace of development I know within the next 5 years we'll have a very different face of analytics just because of that. Taras:    To me it's also a lot about interpretability. Take deep learning for example. Amazing techniques. It allows you to do things that are not possible completely. Analyzing videos, analyzing images that are not possible to do well before deep learning. At the same time, the applicability of deep learning, in truly strategic decision making, is not that high primarily because of that. But I spent a lot of time looking at symbolic equations. Something that can automatically discover features just as deep learning does but it presents those features as symbolic equations. Taras:    That becomes extremely powerful because then you understand what's going on and what drives your outcomes and you can actually explain it to the executives. To me I think there'll be a lot of advances made in our representation of models and in making models more transparent, while using complex models. Simple models we have done. It is really now about complex models but making them understandable. To me that will be another big change that will hopefully happen in another 5 years. Hugo:    Great, having seen how the different parts of data science will evolve in the future, in your mind, how do you see the use of data science within organizations evolving in the coming years? Taras:    It's another fascinating question. I think that data science will be democratized. Part of it is that isolated data teams that we have now in many organizations will become more much embedded within the rest of the organizations. Literally data science will have connections to every business, every function, and as a result will be impacting a lot more decisions. Another piece is that I think data science will be used by some of the non  data scientists, just like when Excel and Spreadsheets came around, suddenly business analysts were able to use it and you didn't need to be a programmer to do it. Taras:    With good graphical interfaces, with algorithms that are much more intelligent, you can actually have people who are business managers or business analysts to use data science tools. I think we'll see a lot more of that in just core data, so data science as well. There'll be hard problems and real data scientists will be solving them and there'll be more standard problem for which we will have really good tools and lots of other people will be able to use them. Hugo:    This is somewhat of a controversial question in a lot of circles but my question for you is can now or is there a future in which data science can be done in a GUI? Taras:    We’re all data scientists, and the reason we don't like GUI is because it's an inefficient way to work but at the same time, if all you do is multivariate regression, and all you need is look at your p-values and look at your regression coefficients, why would you as a data scientist want to do it yourself - writing code in Python? Just give the GUI to business analysts, let them upload it, build in the right checks and balances, and to make sure right significances are done, and help business analysts take intro statistics courses and you're done. I think DataCamp, for example, has done a lot democratizing that knowledge because I know online learning data scientists are so powerful and I think it's not just data scientists that take the courses. At some level we as a data scientist don't want to let it go and sometimes we just don't trust other people to do it right but for us to really continue to have impact, we need to work on really hard problems with continuously new methods and approaches and that means stop working on simpler problems that are very easily solvable that somebody else can do. For me I just see it as a natural progression. Hugo:    I love it. I'd like to know one of your favorite data science techniques or methodologies is. Taras:    I am huge fan of autonomous feature or hypothesis generation. Again to me the ability to find features that drive outcomes, but yet unlike deep learning, ability to express those features through symbolic equations, is hugely powerful, at least in a strategic decision making where we need to have more understanding than precision. I have seen this space evolving very, very rapidly in the last 2-3 years from pretty much zero from before that, to actually now having companies and products that can do it quite well and I think we're just scratching the surface of that. For me the interface of powerful future engineering and interpretability is definitely my favorite area of data science now. Taras:    Another one is, which is my second favorite, is the science of complexity. We talk about building models but if you start thinking about simulating behavior of complex and non-linear dynamic systems that sometimes behave in chaotic ways, they're still guided by rules that can be learned and can be developed. It's fascinating and its impact is huge because our life is essential a complex system and every organization is a complex system. Human bodies are complex systems. Most engineering processes are complex systems so the ability to do it well, with precise mathematics, is absolutely fascinating. And again, I'm beginning to see some data scientists and some software tools being developed that can handle complexity without excessive amount of effort, I would say. To me that's another emerging trend that I think we'll be talking more about 4 or 5 years from now. Hugo:    I really like that the favorite techniques and methodology you mention are very forward looking because the automatic feature hypothesis generation is something which is now and in the future will change what all data scientists do on the daily basis. It will automate a lot of the drudgery, the 80%, so we can focus on the far more exciting and creative work. Taras:    Absolutely. Absolutely. I have no doubt on that because it's already happening and we will just continue to do this in more classes of problems and with more impact. Hugo:    So Taras, to wrap up, do you have a final call to action for our listeners out there? Taras:    My final call is really things are moving so fast now and all of us as data scientists, if we're doing now what we were doing a year ago, we're really falling behind. My call for action, and that's something that I try to do everyday, continue to learn new things everyday. Keep in touch with new software development, keep in touch with new algorithms, understand mathematics and just deploy it because to me that's the biggest fun part about being a data scientist is this learning and the application to new domains, new areas all the time. Taras:    It's very, very nice that we actually have to do that ourselves to stay relevant. Don't do the same thing over and over. Keep looking out for new opportunities. Hugo:    I couldn't agree more and I think the learning new things, especially as you said in a field that's moving so quickly. You also mentioned to learn some of the math as well, which is incredibly important, and to also not be so scared of math because math can be overwhelming in a lot of ways. When you're writing code, bit by bit, the basics of what you're doing, maybe try to re-implement a few of your favorite algorithms, whatever they may be. In terms of learning new things, I may be biased but I think DataCamp is an incredible platform to do that on. I also think McKinsey has a lot of fantastic online resources. As I said, this interactive Executive's Guide to AI, you've actually got a whole bunch of stuff, commentary stuff, released on the economics of AI which I think would provide a wonderful counterpoint to people actually writing code as well. I think all of that is really fantastic and we'll include a link to a bunch of those resources in the show notes. Taras:    Perfect. Could not agree more. Hugo:    Absolutely. So Taras, thank you so much for joining me on the show. It's been absolute pleasure. Taras:    Yeah. Pleasure is mine. Thanks so much for inviting.","Keyword(freq): data(96), analytics(45), tara(33), model(29), decision(16), organization(16), scientist(13), client(10), industry(9), algorithm(8)"
"mastery",2018-07-20,"What is the Difference Between a Batch and an Epoch in a Neural Network?","https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-batch-and-an-epoch/","Stochastic gradient descent is a learning algorithm that has a number of hyperparameters. Two hyperparameters that often confuse beginners are the batch size and number of epochs. They are both integer values and seem to do the same thing. In this post, you will discover the difference between batches and epochs in stochastic gradient descent. After reading this post, you will know: Let’s get started. What is the Difference Between a Batch and an Epoch in a Neural Network?Photo by Graham Cook, some rights reserved. This post is divided into five parts; they are: Stochastic Gradient Descent, or SGD for short, is an optimization algorithm used to train machine learning algorithms, most notably artificial neural networks used in deep learning. The job of the algorithm is to find a set of internal model parameters that perform well against some performance measure such as logarithmic loss or mean squared error. Optimization is a type of searching process and you can think of this search as learning. The optimization algorithm is called “gradient descent“, where “gradient” refers to the calculation of an error gradient or slope of error and “descent” refers to the moving down along that slope towards some minimum level of error. The algorithm is iterative. This means that the search process occurs over multiple discrete steps, each step hopefully slightly improving the model parameters. Each step involves using the model with the current set of internal parameters to make predictions on some samples, comparing the predictions to the real expected outcomes, calculating the error, and using the error to update the internal model parameters. This update procedure is different for different algorithms, but in the case of artificial neural networks, the backpropagation update algorithm is used. Before we dive into batches and epochs, let’s take a look at what we mean by sample. Learn more about gradient descent here: A sample is a single row of data. It contains inputs that are fed into the algorithm and an output that is used to compare to the prediction and calculate an error. A training dataset is comprised of many rows of data, e.g. many samples. A sample may also be called an instance, an observation, an input vector, or a feature vector. Now that we know what a sample is, let’s define a batch. The batch size is a hyperparameter that defines the number of samples to work through before updating the internal model parameters. Think of a batch as a for-loop iterating over one or more samples and making predictions. At the end of the batch, the predictions are compared to the expected output variables and an error is calculated. From this error, the update algorithm is used to improve the model, e.g. move down along the error gradient. A training dataset can be divided into one or more batches. When all training samples are used to create one batch, the learning algorithm is called batch gradient descent. When the batch is the size of one sample, the learning algorithm is called stochastic gradient descent. When the batch size is more than one sample and less than the size of the training dataset, the learning algorithm is called mini-batch gradient descent. In the case of mini-batch gradient descent, popular batch sizes include 32, 64, and 128 samples. You may see these values used in models in the literature and in tutorials. What if the dataset does not divide evenly by the batch size? This can and does happen often when training a model. It simply means that the final batch has fewer samples than the other batches. Alternately, you can remove some samples from the dataset or change the batch size such that the number of samples in the dataset does divide evenly by the batch size. For more on the differences between these variations of gradient descent, see the post: A batch involves an update to the model using samples; next, let’s look at an epoch. The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that defines the number times that the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. One epoch means that each sample in the training dataset has had an opportunity to update the internal model parameters. An epoch is comprised of one or more batches. For example, as above, an epoch that has one batch is called the batch gradient descent learning algorithm. You can think of a for-loop over the number of epochs where each loop proceeds over the training dataset. Within this for-loop is another nested for-loop that iterates over each batch of samples, where one batch has the specified “batch size” number of samples. The number of epochs is traditionally large, often hundreds or thousands, allowing the learning algorithm to run until the error from the model has been sufficiently minimized. You may see examples of the number of epochs in the literature and in tutorials set to 10, 100, 500, 1000, and larger. It is common to create line plots that show epochs along the x-axis as time and the error or skill of the model on the y-axis. These plots are sometimes called learning curves. These plots can help to diagnose whether the model has over learned, under learned, or is suitably fit to the training dataset. For more on diagnostics via learning curves with LSTM networks, see the post: In case it is still not clear, let’s look at the differences between batches and epochs. The batch size is a number of samples processed before the model is updated. The number of epochs is the number of complete passes through the training dataset. The size of a batch must be more than or equal to one and less than or equal to the number of samples in the training dataset. The number of epochs can be set to an integer value between one and infinity. You can run the algorithm for as long as you like and even stop it using other criteria besides a fixed number of epochs, such as a change (or lack of change) in model error over time. They are both integer values and they are both hyperparameters for the learning algorithm, e.g. parameters for the learning process, not internal model parameters found by the learning process. You must specify the batch size and number of epochs for a learning algorithm. There are no magic rules for how to configure these parameters. You must try different values and see what works best for your problem. Finally, let’s make this concrete with a small example. Assume you have a dataset with 200 samples (rows of data) and you choose a batch size of 5 and 1,000 epochs. This means that the dataset will be divided into 40 batches, each with five samples. The model weights will be updated after each batch of five samples. This also means that one epoch will involve 40 batches or 40 updates to the model. With 1,000 epochs, the model will be exposed to or pass through the whole dataset 1,000 times. That is a total of 40,000 batches during the entire training process. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered the difference between batches and epochs in stochastic gradient descent. Specifically, you learned: Do you have any questions?

"mastery",2018-07-18,"The Role of Randomization to Address Confounding Variables in Machine Learning","https://machinelearningmastery.com/confounding-variables-in-machine-learning/","A large part of applied machine learning is about running controlled experiments to discover what algorithm or algorithm configuration to use on a predictive modeling problem. A challenge is that there are aspects of the problem and the algorithm called confounding variables that cannot be controlled (held constant) and must be controlled-for. An example is the use of randomness in a learning algorithm, such as random initialization or random choices during learning. The solution is to use randomness in a way that has become a standard in applied machine learning. We can learn more about the rationale for using randomness in controlled experiments by looking briefly at why randomness is used to manage confounding variables in medicine through the use of randomized clinical trials. In this post, you will discover confounding variables and how we can address them using the tool of randomization. After reading this post, you will know: Let’s get started.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course In an experiment, we are often interested in the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable. A confounding variable is a variable that confuses the relationship between the independent and the dependent variable. Confounding, sometimes referred to as confounding bias, is mostly described as a ‘mixing’ or ‘blurring’ of effects. <U+2014> Confounding: What it is and how to deal with it, 2008. A confounding variable can influence the outcome of an experiment in many ways, such as: A confounding variable may be known or unknown. They are often characterized as having an association or correlation with both the independent and dependent variables. Another characterization is that the confounding variable affects groups or observations differently. Confounding variables or confounders are often defined as the variables correlate (positively or negatively) with both the dependent variable and the independent variable. A Confounder is an extraneous variable whose presence affects the variables being studied so that the results do not reflect the actual relationship between the variables under study. <U+2014> How to control confounding effects by statistical analysis, 2012. The deeper difficulty of confounding variables is that it may not be obvious that they exist and are impacting results. The effects of confounding variables are often not obvious or even identifiable unless they are specifically addressed in the design of the experiment or data collection method. Confounding variables are traditionally a concern in applied statistics. This is because in statistics we are often concerned with the effect of independent variables on dependent variables in data. Statistical methods are designed to discover and describe these relationships and confounding variables can essentially corrupt or invalidate discoveries. Machine learning practitioners are typically interested in the skill of a predictive model and less concerned with the statistical correctness or interpretability of the model. As such, confounding variables are an important topic when it comes to data selection and preparation, but less important than they may be when developing descriptive statistical models. Nevertheless, confounding variables are critically important in applied machine learning. The evaluation of a machine learning model is an experiment with independent and dependent variables. As such, it is subject to confounding variables. What may be surprising is that you already know this and that the gold-standard practices in applied machine learning address this. Therefore, being intimately aware of the confounding variables in machine learning experiments is required to understand the choice and interpretation of machine learning model evaluation. Consider, what impacts the evaluation of a machine learning model, what are the independent variables? Some examples include: Each of these choices will impact the dependent variable in a machine learning experiment, which is the chosen metric used to estimate the skill of the model when making predictions. The evaluation of a machine learning model involves the design and execution of controlled experiments. A controlled experiment holds all elements constant except one element under study. The two most common types of controlled experiments in machine learning are: Nevertheless, there are confounding variables that the controlled experiments cannot hold constant. Specifically, there are sources of randomness, that if they were held constant would result in an invalid evaluation of the model. Three examples include: For example, weights in a neural network are initialized to random values. Stochastic gradient descent randomizes the order of samples in an epoch to vary the types of updates performed. Random subsets of features are selected for each possible cut point in random forest. And many more examples. Randomization in machine learning algorithms is not a bug; it is a feature intended to improve the performance of the model on average over classical deterministic methods. Randomness can be present in ML at many different levels, usually enhancing performance or alleviating problems and difficulties of classical methods. <U+2014> Randomized Machine Learning Approaches: Recent Developments and Challenges, 2017. These are confounding variables that we cannot hold constant. If they are held constant, the evaluation of the model will no longer provide insight into the generalizability of the result. We will know how well the model performs on a specific data sample or initialization of sequence of decisions during learning, but little idea on how the model will perform in general. The way that we can handle confounding variables that we cannot control is by using randomization. Randomization is a technique used in experimental design to give control over confounding variables that cannot (should not) be held constant. For example, randomization is used in clinical experiments to control-for the biological differences between individual human beings when evaluating a treatment. It is the reason why a treatment must be evaluated on multiple individuals rather than on a single individual before the findings can be generalized. In randomization the random assignment of study subjects to exposure categories to breaking any links between exposure and confounders. This reduces potential for confounding by generating groups that are fairly comparable with respect to known and unknown confounding variables. <U+2014> How to control confounding effects by statistical analysis, 2012. Randomization is a simple tool in experimental design that allows the confounding variables to have their effect across a sample. It shifts the experiment from looking at an individual case to a collection of observations, where statistical tools are used to interpret the finding. In medicine, randomization is the gold standard for evaluating a treatment and is called the randomized clinical trial. It is designed to remove not only the confounding effects of biological differences, but also the bias, such as the effect of the experimenter choosing the members of the treatment and non-treatment groups. You can imagine that a treatment would look very successful if the least-sick members of a cohort were chosen to be administered. An [Randomized clinical trial] is a special kind of cohort study, with the characteristic that patients are randomly assigned to the experimental group (with exposure) and the control group (without exposure). […] Therefore, randomization helps to prevent selection by the clinician, and helps to establish groups that are equal with respect to relevant prognostic factors. <U+2014> The randomized clinical trial: An unbeatable standard in clinical research?, 2007. There are still confounding variables when using a randomized clinical trial. An example is the case where the experimenters know what treatment participants of the study are receiving. This can impact the way the experimenters interact with the participants, which in turn can impact the results of the experiment. The answer is to use blinding where participants or experimenters do not know the treatment. Ideally, a double-blind experiment is adopted, ensuring that both participates and experimenters are unaware of their treatment. When feasible, it is strongly recommended that also after randomization, patients and clinicians do not know who receives the intervention and who does not. Studies may be single blind (either the patient or the clinician does not know who receives the treatment and who does not) or double blind (both the patient and the clinician do not know who receives the treatment). <U+2014> The randomized clinical trial: An unbeatable standard in clinical research?, 2007. Note, before we move on to look at the use of randomization in machine learning, consider that there are other approaches to managing the effect of confounding variables. Wikipedia has a good list here. Randomization is used in the evaluation of machine learning models to manage the uncontrollable confounding variables. It is key to the standard ways described for evaluating machine learning models and the rationale for using methods such as data resampling and repeating experiments. Randomization allows the machine learning practitioner to generalize a finding, to make it useful and applicable. It’s the reason why careful design of the test harness and resampling method is important. It is the reason why we repeat the evaluation of a model and the reason we don’t fix the seed on the pseudorandom number generator. I talk more about these topics in the posts: When we take a closer look at why we use randomization, to control for confounding variables, it raises questions about the other confounders that we may not be controlling for. For example, the machine learning practitioner knowing the skill of models prior to giving each model a chance to do its best via data preparation and hyperparameter tuning. Perhaps practitioners should blind themselves to remove the possibility of biasing the choice of final model. The risk is that the practitioner that really likes artificial neural networks will “discover” a neural network configuration that outperforms other models. At best it is a statistical fluke or violation of Occam’s Razor for a parsimonious solution to a predictive modeling project; at worst, it is scientific fraud. The reason that clinicians aggressively removed this bias is people’s lives were at risk. We may get to that point with machine learning algorithms, e.g. in cars. In practice, today, I think this is good motivation for front-loading an experiment with a large and careful design and automating the execution and statistical interpretation of the results. This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper. In this post, you discovered confounding variables and how we can address them using the tool of randomization.

"mastery",2018-07-16,"All of Statistics for Machine Learning","https://machinelearningmastery.com/all-of-statistics-for-machine-learning/","A foundation in statistics is required to be effective as a machine learning practitioner. The book “All of Statistics” was written specifically to provide a foundation in probability and statistics for computer science undergraduates that may have an interest in data mining and machine learning. As such, it is often recommended as a book to machine learning practitioners interested in expanding their understanding of statistics. In this post, you will discover the book “All of Statistics”, the topics it covers, and a reading list intended for machine learning practitioners. After reading this post, you will know: Let’s get started. All of Statistics for Machine LearningPhoto by Chris Sorge, some rights reserved. The book “All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference” was written by Larry Wasserman and released in 2004. All of Statistics Wasserman is a professor of statistics and data science at Carnegie Mellon University. The book is ambitious. It seeks to quickly bring computer science students up-to-speed with probability and statistics. As such, the topics covered by the book are very broad, perhaps broader than the average introductory textbooks. Taken literally, the title “All of Statistics” is an exaggeration. But in spirit, the title is apt, as the book does cover a much broader range of topics than a typical introductory book on mathematical statistics. This book is for people who want to learn probability and statistics quickly. <U+2014> Page vii, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, 2004. The book is not for the average practitioner; it is intended for computer science undergraduate students. It does assume some prior knowledge in calculus and linear algebra. If you don’t like equations or mathematical notation, this book is not for you. Interestingly, Wasserman wrote the book in response to the rise of data mining and machine learning in computer science occurring outside of classical statistics. He asserts in the preface the importance of having a grounding in statistics in order to be effective in machine learning. Using fancy tools like neural nets, boosting, and support vector machines without understanding basic statistics is like doing brain surgery before knowing how to use a band-aid. <U+2014> Pages vii-viii, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, 2004. The material is presented in a very clear and concise manner. A systematic approach is taken with brief descriptions of a method, equations describing its implementation, and worked examples to motivate the use of the method with sample code in R. In fact, the material is so compact that it often reads like a series of encyclopedia examples. This is great if you want to know how to implement a method, but very challenging if you are new to the methods and seeking intuitions. Take my free 7-day email crash course now (with sample code). Click to sign-up and also get a free PDF Ebook version of the course. Download Your FREE Mini-Course The choice of topics covered by the book is very broad, as mentioned in the previous section. This is great on the one hand as the reader is given exposure to advanced subjects early on. The downside of this aggressive scope is that topics are touched on briefly with very little hand holding. You are left to re-read sections until you get it. Let’s look at the topics covered by the book. This is helpful to both get an idea of the presented scope of the field and the context for the topics that may interest you as a machine learning practitioner. The book is divided into three parts; they are: The first part of the book focuses on probability theory and formal language for describing uncertainty. The second part is focused on statistical inference. The third part focuses on specific methods and problems raised in the second part. The book does have a reference or encyclopedia feeling. As such, there are a lot of chapters, but each chapter is reasonably standalone. The book is divided into 24 chapters; they are: The preface for the book provides a useful glossary of terms mapping them from statistics to computer science. This “Statistics/Data Mining Dictionary” is reproduced below. Statistics/Data Mining DictionaryTaken from “All of Statistics“. All of the R code and datasets used in the worked examples in the book are available from Wasserman’s homepage. This is very helpful as you can focus on experimenting with the examples rather than typing in the code and hoping that you got the syntax correct. I would not recommend this book to developers who have not touched statistics before. It’s too challenging. I would recommend this book to computer science students who are in math-learning-mode. I would also recommend it to machine learning practitioners with some previous background in statistics or a strong mathematical foundation. If you are comfortable with mathematical notation and you know what you’re looking for, this book is an excellent reference. You can flip to the topic or the method and get a crisp presentation. The problem is, for a machine learning practitioner, you do need to know about many of these topics, just not at the level of detail presented. Perhaps a shade lighter, at the intuition level. If you are up to it, it would be worth reading (or skimming) the following chapters in order to build a solid foundation in probability for statistics: Again, these are important topics, but you require a concept-level understanding only. For coverage of statistical hypothesis tests that you may use to interpret data and compare the skill of models, the following chapters are recommended reading: I would also recommend the chapter on the Bootstrap. It’s just a great method to have in your head, but with a focus for either better understanding bagging and random forest or as a procedure for estimating confidence intervals of model skill. Finally, a statistical approach is used to present machine learning algorithms. I would recommend these chapters if you prefer a more mathematical treatment of regression and classification algorithms: I can read the mathematical presentation of statistics, but I prefer intuitions and working code. I am less likely to pick up this book from my bookcase, in favor of gentler treatments such as “Statistics in Plain English” or application focused treatments such as “Empirical Methods for Artificial Intelligence“. Do you agree with this reading list?

Over the last 10 years, they have created an offline distribution channel across country. They sell Financial products to consumers by hiring agents in their network. These agents are freelancers and get commission when they make a product sale. The data scientists at BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for an entire year. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. You will build a predictive model to forecast the sales of each product at a particular store. You will analyse what kind of people were likely to survive in Titanic tragedy. You will apply machine learning tools to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

From detecting objects in a video, to counting the number of people in a crowd, there is no challenge that computer vision seemingly cannot overcome. One of the more intriguing applications of computer vision is identifying pixels in a scene and using them for diverse and remarkably useful purposes. We will be taking up one such application in this article, and trying to understand how it works using Python! The aim of this post is to build a custom Mask R-CNN model that can detect the area of damage on a car (see the image example above). The rationale for such a model is that it can be used by insurance companies for faster processing of claims if users can upload pics and they can assess damage from them. This model can also be used by lenders if they are underwriting a car loan especially for a used car. Sponsored: Check out our Computer Vision using Deep Learning Course for creating Computer Vision applications Mask R-CNN is an instance segmentation model that allows us to identify pixel wise location for our class. “Instance segmentation” means segmenting individual objects within a scene, regardless of whether they are of the same type<U+200A><U+2014><U+200A>i.e, identifying individual cars, persons, etc. Check out the below GIF of a Mask-RCNN model trained on the<U+00A0>COCO<U+00A0>dataset. As you can see, we can identify pixel locations for cars, persons, fruits, etc. Mask R-CNN is different from classical object detection models like Faster R-CNN where, in addition to identifying the class and its bounding box location, it can also color pixels in the bounding box that correspond to that class. When do you think we would be need this additional detail? Some examples I can think of are: The easiest way to try a Mask R-CNN model built on COCO classes is to use the<U+00A0>Tensorflow Object Detection API. You can refer to this article (written by me) that has information on how to use the API and run the model on YouTube videos. Before we build a Mask R-CNN model, let’s first understand how it actually works. A good way to think about Mask R-CNN is that it is a combination of a Faster R-CNN that does object detection (class + bounding box) and FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) that does pixel wise boundary. See figure below: Mask R-CNN is conceptually simple: Faster R-CNN has two outputs for each candidate object, a class label and a bounding-box offset; to this we add a third branch that outputs the object mask<U+200A><U+2014><U+200A>which is a binary mask that indicates the pixels where the object is in the bounding box. But the additional mask output is distinct from the class and box outputs, requiring extraction of much finer spatial layout of an object. To do this Mask R-CNN uses the<U+00A0>Fully Convolution Network (FCN) described below. FCN is a popular algorithm for doing semantic segmentation. This model uses various blocks of convolution and max pool layers to first decompress an image to 1/32th of its original size. It then makes a class prediction at this level of granularity. Finally it uses up sampling and deconvolution layers to resize the image to its original dimensions. So, in short, we can say that Mask R-CNN combines the two networks<U+200A><U+2014><U+200A>Faster R-CNN and FCN in one mega architecture. The loss function for the model is the total loss in doing classification, generating bounding box and generating the mask. Mask RCNN has a couple of additional improvements that make it much more accurate than FCN. You can read more about them in their<U+00A0>paper. For building a custom Mask R-CNN, we will leverage the<U+00A0>Matterport Github repository. The latest TensorFlow Object Detection repository also provides the option to build Mask R-CNN. However I would only recommend this for the strong-hearted! The versions of TensorFlow, object detection, format for mask, etc. can demand debugging of errors. I was able to successfully train a Mask R-CNN using it. But I have seen many people struggle with all kinds of errors. So I now highly recommend the<U+00A0>Matterport Mask R-CNN repository to anyone venturing into this domain. For this exercise, I collected 66 images (50 train and 16 validation) of damaged cars from Google. Check out some examples below. A Mask R-CNN model requires the user to annotate the images and identify the region of damage. The annotation tool I used is the VGG Image Annotator<U+200A><U+2014><U+200A>v 1.0.6. You can use the html version available at this<U+00A0>link. Using this tool you can create a polygon mask as shown below: Once you have created all the annotations, you can download the annotation and save it in a json format. You can look at my images and annotations on my repository here. Now we start the interesting work of actually training the model! Start by cloning the ‘Matterport Mask R-CNN’ repository<U+2014><U+200A>https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN. Next we will load our images and annotations. I have used the balloon.py file shared by Matterport and modified it to create a custom code that loads images and annotations and adds them to a CustomDataset class. Check out the entire code here. Follow the same code block and update it for any specifics for your class. Please note that this code only works for one class. Further, you can use this notebook<U+00A0>to visualize the mask on the given images. See an example of this below: To train the model, we use the COCO trained model as the checkpoint to perform transfer learning. You can download this model from the Matterport repository as well. To train the model, run the below code block: I am using a GPU and trained the model for 10 epochs in 20<U+2013>30 minutes. You can inspect the model weights using the notebook<U+200A><U+2014><U+200A>Inspect Custom Weights. Please link your last checkpoint in this notebook. This notebook can help you perform a sanity check if your weights and biases are properly distributed. See a sample output below: Use the notebook<U+00A0>inspect_custom_model<U+00A0>to run model on images from test/val set and see model predictions. See a sample result below: And there you have it! You just built a Mask R-CNN model to detect damage on a car. What an awesome way to learn deep learning. Mask-RCNN is the next evolution of object detection models which allow detection with better precision. A big thanks to Matterport for making their repository public and allowing us to leverage it to build custom models. This is just a small example of what we can accomplish with this wonderful model. If you have any questions, or feedback for me on this article, please share it using the comments section below. that’s a cool application Priya.
Thanks for sharing that, I’ll need some time to digest all of that. Helllo Priya,
The post is really cool. I am trying to just draw a bounding box over the damaged area and possibly try to crop it out from the image and also name the part of the car it is. Is this possible ? I am actually trying to build a system that can quantitatively tell out how much a car is damaged from the provided image and also the parts that are damaged. Please do suggest me a good way to do it. Possibly any reference links available too.
Thank you","Keyword(freq): image(7), annotation(4), application(3), car(3), model(3), pixel(3), weight(3), error(2), example(2), layer(2)"
"vidhya",2018-07-19,"MyStory: Step by Step process of How I Became a Machine Learning Expert in 10 Months","https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/07/mystory-became-a-machine-learning-expert-10-months/","Not so long ago, using the pivot tables option in Excel was the upper limit of my skills with numbers and the word python was more likely to make me think about a dense jungle or a nature program on TV than a tool to generate business insights and create complex solutions. It took me ten months to leave that life behind and start feeling like I belonged to the exclusive world of people who can tell their medians from their means, their x-bars from the neighborhood pub, and who know how to teach machines what they need to learn. The transformation process was not easy and demanded hard work, lots of time, dedication and required plenty of help along the way. It also involved well over hundreds of hours of “studying” in different forms and an equal amount of time practicing and applying all that was being learnt. In short, it wasn’t easy to transform from being data dumb to a data nerd, but I managed to do so while going through a terribly busy work schedule as well as being a dad to a one-year old. The point of this article is to help you if you are looking to make a similar transformation but do not know where to start and how to proceed from one step to the next. If you are interested in finding out, read on to get an idea about the topics you need to cover and also develop an understanding of the level of expertise you need to build at each stage of the learning process.  There are plenty of great online and offline resources to help you master each of these steps, but very often, the trouble for the uninitiated can be in figuring out where to start and where to finish. I hope spending the next ten to fifteen minutes going through this article will help solve that problem for you.  And finally, before proceeding any further, I would like to point out that I had a lot of help in making this transformation. Right at the end of the article, I will reveal how I managed to squeeze in so much learning and work in a matter of ten months. But that’s for later. For now, I want to give you more details about the nine steps that I had to go through in my transformation process. Spend a couple of weeks enhancing your “general knowledge” about the field of data science and machine learning. You may already have ideas and some sort of understanding about what the field is, but if you want to become an expert, you need to understand the finer details to a point where you can explain it in simple terms to just about anyone. Suggested topics: <U+00A0><U+00A0> Exercise to show that you know: I have a confession to make. Even though I feel like a machine learning expert, I do not feel that I have any level of expertise in statistics. Which should be good news for people who struggle with concepts in statistics as much as I do, as it proves that you can be a data scientist without being a statistician. Having said that, you cannot ignore statistical concepts <U+2013> not in machine learning and data science!  So what you need to do is to understand certain concepts and know when they may be applied or used. If you can also completely understand the theory behind these concepts, give yourself a few good pats on your back.  Suggested topics: <U+00A0><U+00A0> Suggested exercise to mark completion of this step: Programming turned out to be easier to learn, more fun and more rewarding in terms of the things it made possible, than I had ever imagined. While mastering a programming language could be an eternal quest, at this stage, you need to get familiar with the process of learning a language and that is not too difficult. Both Python and R are very popular and mastering one can make it quite easy to learn the other. I started with R and have slowly started using Python for doing similar tasks as well.  Suggested topics: Know that you are set for the next step: In the first cricket test match ever played (see scorecard), Australian Charles Bannerman scored 67.35% (165 out of 245) of his team’s total score, in the very first innings of cricket’s history. This remains a record in cricket at the time of writing, for the highest share of the total score by a batsman in an innings of a test match. What makes the innings even more remarkable is that the other 43 innings in that test match had an average of only 10.8 runs an innings, with only about 40% of all batsmen registering a score of ten or more runs. In fact, the second highest score by an Australian in the match was 20 runs. Given that Australia won the match by 45 runs, we can say with conviction that Bannerman’s innings was the most important contributor to Australia’s win. Just like we were able to build this story from the scorecard of the test match, exploratory data analysis is about studying data to understand the story that is hidden beneath it, and then sharing the story with everyone. Personally, I find this phase of a data project the most interesting, which is a good thing as quite a lot of the time in a typical project could be expected to be taken up by exploratory data analysis.  Topics to cover: Project output:<U+00A0> Let’s say we had data for all the countries in the world across many parameters ranging from population, to income, to health, to major industries and more. Now suppose we wanted to find out which countries are similar to each other across all these parameters. How do we go about doing this, when we have to compare each country with all the others, across over 50 different parameters? That is where unsupervised machine learning algorithms come in. This is not the time to bore you with details about what these are all about, but the good news is that once you reach this stage, you have moved on into the world of machine learning and are already in elite company. Topics to cover: Milestone exercise: If you had data about millions of loan applicants and their repayment history from the past, could you identify an applicant who is likely to default on payments, even before the loan is approved? Given enough prior data, could you predict which users are more likely to respond to a digital advertising campaign? Could you identify if someone is more likely to develop a certain disease later in their life based on their current lifestyle and habits? Supervised learning algorithms help solve all these problems and a lot more. While there are a plethora of algorithms to understand and master, just getting started with some of the most popular ones will open up a world of new possibilities for you and the ways in which you can make data useful for an organization.  Topics to cover: You have not really started with creating models till you have done this: Many of the machine learning models in use today have been around for decades. The reason why these algorithms are only finding applications now, is that we finally have access to sufficiently large amounts of data, that can be supplied to these algorithms for them to be able to come up with useful outputs. Data engineering and architecture is a field of specialization in itself, but every machine learning expert must know how to deal with big data systems, irrespective of their specialization within the industry. Understanding how large amounts of data can be stored, accessed and processed efficiently is important to being able to create solutions that can be implemented in practice and are not just theoretical exercises.  I had approached this step with a real lack of conviction, but as I soon found out, it was driven more by the fear of the unknown in the form of Linux interfaces than any real complexity in finding my way around a Hadoop system. <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0> Topics to cover: Do this to know that you have understood the basics: Deep learning models are helping companies like Apple and Google create solutions like Siri or the Google Assistant. They are helping global giants test driverless cars and suggesting best courses of treatment to doctors. Machines are able to see, listen, read, write and speak thanks to deep learning models that are going to transform the world in many ways, including significantly changing the skills required for people to be useful to organizations. Getting started with creating a model that can tell the image of a flower from a fruit may not immediately help you start building your own driverless car, but it will certainly help you start seeing the path to getting there. Topics to cover: Milestone exercise: By now you are almost ready to unleash yourself to the world as a machine learning pro, but you need to showcase all that you have learnt before anyone else will be willing to agree with you. <U+00A0> The internet presents glorious opportunities to find such projects. If you have been diligent about the previous eight steps, chances are that you would already know how to find a project that will excite you, be useful to someone, as well as help demonstrate your knowledge and skills. Topics to cover: Milestone exercise: Machine learning and artificial intelligence is a set of skills for the present and future. It is also a field where learning will never cease and very often you may have to keep running to stay in the same place, as far as being equipped with the most in-demand skills is concerned. However, if you start the journey well, you will be able to understand how to go about taking the next step in your learning path. As you must have gathered by now, starting the journey well is a pretty challenging exercise in itself. If you choose to start upon it, I hope this article will have been of some help to you and I wish you the very best. Finally, I will confess that I got a lot of help with my ten-month transition. The reason I was able to cover so much ground in this amount of time, along with a busy schedule at work and home, was that I enrolled for the Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Machine Learning offered by Jigsaw Academy and Graham School, University of Chicago. Investing in the course helped in keeping my learning hours focused, created external pressure that ensured that I was finding time for it irrespective of whatever else was going on in life, and gave me access to experts in the form of faculty and a great peer group through other students.  Transforming from being non-technical to someone who is comfortable with the machine learning world has already opened up many new doors for me. Whatever path you choose to make this transformation, you can do so with the assurance that going through the rigor will reap rewards for a long time and will banish any fears of becoming irrelevant in tomorrow’s economy.

"vidhya",2018-07-16,"An Introductory Guide to Maximum Likelihood Estimation (with a case study in R)","https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/07/introductory-guide-maximum-likelihood-estimation-case-study-r/","Interpreting how a model works is one of the most basic yet critical aspects of data science. You build a model which is giving you pretty impressive results, but what was the process behind it? As a data scientist, you need to have an answer to this oft-asked question. For example, let’s say you built a model to predict the stock price of a company. You observed that the stock price increased rapidly over night. There could be multiple reasons behind it. Finding the likelihood of the most probable reason is what Maximum Likelihood Estimation is all about. This concept is used in economics, MRIs, satellite imaging, among other things. Source: YouTube In this post we will look into how Maximum Likelihood Estimation (referred as MLE hereafter) works and how it can be used to determine coefficients of a model with any kind of distribution. Understanding MLE would involve probability and mathematics, but I will try to make it easier with examples. Note: As mentioned, this article assumes that you know the basics of maths and probability. You can refresh your concepts by going through this article first <U+2013><U+00A0>6 Common Probability Distributions every data science professional should know. Let us say we want to predict the sale of tickets for an event. The data has the following histogram and density. How would you model such a variable? The variable is not normally distributed and is asymmetric and hence it violates the assumptions of linear regression. A popular way is to transform the variable with log, sqrt, reciprocal, etc. so that the transformed variable is normally distributed and can be modelled with linear regression. <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0> Let’s try these transformations and see how the results are: With Log transformation:  With Square Root Transformation: With Reciprocal:  None of these are close to a normal distribution. How should we model such data so that the basic assumptions of the model are not violated? How about modelling this data with a different distribution rather than a normal one? If we do use a different distribution, how will we estimate the coefficients?  This is where Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) has such a major advantage. While studying stats and probability, you must have come across problems like <U+2013> What is the probability of x > 100, given that x follows a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation (sd) 10. In such problems, we already know the distribution (normal in this case) and its parameters (mean and sd) but in real life problems these quantities are unknown and must be estimated from the data. MLE is the technique which helps us in determining the parameters of the distribution that best describe the given data. Let’s understand this with an example: Suppose we have data points representing the weight (in kgs) of students in a class. The data points are shown in the figure below (the R code that was used to generate the image is provided as well): Figure 1 This appears to follow a normal distribution. But how do we get the mean and standard deviation (sd) for this distribution? One way is to directly compute the mean and sd of the given data, which comes out to be 49.8 Kg and 11.37 respectively. These values are a good representation of the given data but may not best describe the population. We can use MLE in order to get more robust parameter estimates. Thus, MLE can be defined as a method for estimating population parameters (such as the mean and variance for Normal, rate (lambda) for Poisson, etc.) from sample data such that the probability (likelihood) of obtaining the observed data is maximized.  In order to get an intuition of MLE, try to guess which of the following would maximize the probability of observing the data in the above figure? Clearly, it is not very likely we’ll observe the above data shape if the population mean is 100. Now that you got an intuition of what MLE can do, we can get into the details of what actually likelihood is and how it can be maximized. But first, let’s start with a quick review of distribution parameters. Let us first understand distribution parameters. Wikipedia’s definition of this term is as follows: “It is a quantity that indexes a family of probability distributions”. It can be regarded as a numerical characteristic of a population or a statistical model. We can understand it by the following diagram: Figure 2, Source: Wikipedia The width and height of the bell curve is governed by two parameters <U+2013> mean and variance. These are known as distribution parameters for normal distribution. Similarly, Poisson distribution is governed by one parameter <U+2013> lambda, which is the<U+00A0>number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space. Figure 3, Source: Wikipedia Most of the distributions have one or two parameters, but some distributions can have up to 4 parameters, like a 4 parameter beta distribution.  From Fig. 2 and 3 we can see that given a set of distribution parameters, some data values are more probable than other data. From Fig. 1, we have seen that the given data is more likely to occur when the<U+00A0>mean is 50, rather than<U+00A0>100. In reality however, we have already observed the data. Accordingly, we are faced with an inverse problem: Given the observed data and a model of interest, we need to find the one Probability Density Function/Probability Mass Function (f(x|θ)), among all the probability densities that are most likely to have produced the data. To solve this inverse problem, we define the likelihood function by reversing the roles of the data vector x and the (distribution) parameter vector θ in f(x| θ),<U+00A0>i.e., L(θ;x) = f(x| θ) In MLE, we can assume that we have a likelihood function L(θ;x), where θ<U+00A0>is the distribution parameter vector and x is the set of observations. We are interested in finding the value of θ that maximizes the likelihood with given observations (values of x).  The mathematical problem at hand becomes simpler if we assume that the observations (xi) are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from a Probability Distribution, f0 (where f0<U+00A0>= Normal Distribution for example in Fig.1). This reduces the Likelihood function to:<U+00A0><U+00A0> To find the maxima/minima of this function, we can take the derivative of this function w.r.t θ<U+00A0>and equate it to 0 (as zero slope indicates maxima or minima). Since we have terms in product here, we need to apply the chain rule which is quite cumbersome with products. A clever trick would be to take log of the likelihood function and maximize the same. This will convert the product to sum and since log is a strictly increasing function, it would not impact the resulting value of θ. So we have: To find the maxima of the log likelihood function LL(θ; x), we can: There are many situations where calculus is of no direct help in maximizing a likelihood, but a maximum can still be readily identified. There’s nothing that gives setting the first derivative equal to zero any kind of ‘primacy’ or special place in finding the parameter value(s) that maximize log-likelihood. It’s simply a convenient tool when a few parameters need to be estimated.  As a general principle, pretty much any valid approach for identifying the argmax of a function may be suitable to find maxima of the log likelihood function. This is an unconstrained non-linear optimization problem. We seek an optimization algorithm that behaves in the following manner: It’s very common to use optimization techniques to maximize likelihood; there are a large variety of methods (Newton’s method, Fisher scoring, various conjugate gradient-based approaches, steepest descent, Nelder-Mead type (simplex) approaches, BFGS and a wide variety of other techniques).  It turns out that when the model is assumed to be Gaussian as in the examples above, the MLE estimates are equivalent to the ordinary least squares method. You can refer to the proof here. Let us now look at how MLE can be used to determine the coefficients of a predictive model.<U+00A0><U+00A0> Suppose that we have a sample of n observations y1, y2, . . . , yn which can be treated as realizations of independent Poisson random variables, with Yi ∼ P(μi). Also, suppose that we want to let the mean μi (and therefore the variance!) depend on a vector of explanatory variables xi . We could form a simple linear model as follows <U+2013>  where<U+00A0>θ<U+00A0>is the vector of model coefficients. This model has the disadvantage that the linear predictor on the right-hand side can assume any real value, whereas the Poisson mean on the left-hand side, which represents an expected count, has to be non-negative. A straightforward solution to this problem is to model the logarithm of the mean using a linear model. Thus, we consider a generalized linear model with log link log, which can be written as follows <U+2013>  Our aim is to find θ by using MLE.  Now, Poisson distribution is given by: We can apply the log likelihood concept that we learnt in the previous section to find the θ. Taking logs of the above equation and ignoring a constant involving log(y!), we find that the log-likelihood function is <U+2013> where μi depends on the covariates xi and a vector of<U+00A0>θ coefficients.<U+00A0>We can substitute μi = exp(xi’θ) and solve the equation to get<U+00A0>θ<U+00A0>that maximizes the likelihood.<U+00A0>Once we have the<U+00A0>θ<U+00A0>vector, we can then predict the expected value of the mean by multiplying the xi and θ vector. In this section, we will use a real-life dataset to solve a problem using the concepts learnt earlier.<U+00A0>You can download the dataset from this link.<U+00A0><U+00A0>A sample from the dataset is as follows:  <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0>Datetime  Count of tickets sold 25-08-2012 00:00   <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0> 8 25-08-2012 01:00 <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0> 2 25-08-2012 02:00 <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0> 6 25-08-2012 03:00 <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0> 2 25-08-2012 04:00 <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0> 2 25-08-2012 05:00 <U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0><U+00A0> 2 It has the count of tickets sold in each hour from 25th Aug 2012 to 25th Sep 2014<U+00A0> (about 18K records). Our aim is to predict the number of tickets sold in each hour. This is the same dataset which was discussed in the first section of this article.  The problem can be solved using techniques like regression, time series, etc. Here we will use the statistical modeling technique that we have learnt above using R. Let’s first analyze the data. In statistical modelling, we are concerned more with how the target variable is distributed. Let’s have a look at the distribution of counts: <U+00A0> This could be treated as a Poisson distribution or we could even try fitting an exponential distribution.  Since the variable at hand is count of tickets, Poisson is a more suitable model for this. Exponential distribution is generally used to model time interval between events. Let’s plot the count of tickets sold over these 2 years: Looks like there is a significant increase in sale of tickets over time.<U+00A0>In order to keep things simple, let’s model the outcome by only using age as a factor, where age is the defined no. of weeks elapsed since 25th Aug 2012. We can write this as: where, μ (Count of tickets sold) is assumed to follow the mean of Poisson distribution and θ0<U+00A0>and θ1 are the coefficients that we need to estimate.  Combining Eq. 1 and 2, we get the log likelihood function as follows: We can use the mle() function in R stats4 package to estimate the coefficients θ0<U+00A0>and θ1. It needs the following primary parameters:  For our example, the negative log likelihood function can be coded as follows: I have divided the data into train and test set so that we can objectively evaluate the performance of the model. idx is the indices of the rows which are in test set. Next let’s call the mle function to get the parameters: This gives us the estimate of the coefficients. Let’s use RMSE as the evaluation metric for getting results on the test set: Now let’s see how our model fairs against the standard linear model (with errors normally distributed), modelled with log of count.  As you can see, RMSE for the standard linear model is higher than our model with Poisson distribution.<U+00A0>Let’s compare the residual plots for these 2 models on a held out sample to see how the models perform in different regions: We see that the errors using Poisson regression are much closer to zero when compared to Normal linear regression.  Similar thing can be achieved in Python by using the<U+00A0>scipy.optimize.minimize() function which accepts objective function to minimize, initial guess for the parameters and methods like BFGS, L-BFGS, etc. Its further simpler to model popular distributions in R using the glm function from the<U+00A0>stats package. It supports Poisson, Gamma, Binomial, Quasi, Inverse Gaussian, Quasi Binomial, Quasi Poisson distributions out of the box. For the example shown above, you can get the coefficients directly using the below command: Same can be done in Python using pymc.glm() and setting the family as pm.glm.families.Poisson().  One way to think of the above example is that there exist better coefficients in the parameter space than those estimated by a standard linear model. Normal distribution is the default and most widely used form of distribution, but we can obtain better results if the correct distribution is used instead. Maximum likelihood estimation is a technique which can be used to estimate the distribution parameters irrespective of the distribution used. So next time you have a modelling problem at hand, first look at the distribution of data and see if something other than normal makes more sense! The detailed code and data is present on my Github repository.<U+00A0>Refer to the “Modelling single variables.R” file for an example that covers data reading, formatting and modelling using only age variables. I have also modelled using multiple variables, which is present in the<U+00A0>“Modelling multiple variables.R” file.","Keyword(freq): data(24), parameter(15), coefficient(10), ticket(8), variable(7), distribution(6), observation(4), result(4), bfg(3), problem(3)"
